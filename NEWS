GNU swbis NEWS  Noteworthy changes. August 2014 (2014-08)

version 1.12 - Jim Lowe,  2014-08-02

   NEW FEATURES:

     * pax extended headers are now supported for name and file
       attributes too long for traditional tar.

     * The '-H pax' option of GNU tar is specified for all uses
       of the system tar utility.  A runtime check is made to support
       generic tar as much as possible.
     
     * Now multiple signatures are supported both in a package archive
       and in installed software.

     * 'swpackage' now has capability to resign, add and delete
        signatures of a previously signed package.

   NEW FIXES, among many others (See ./ChangeLog).

     * <all utilities except swpackage>
       A rare hang when accessing the installed software catalog is
       probably fixed.

     * <swverify>
       Now the package catalog is not decoded if the package signature
       fails.

     * <swverify>
       Fixed hang on non-Linux kernels.

     * <swverify>
       Added a new feature to verify prelink'ed binaries
       using prelink(8) on systems that use prelink.

     * <swverify>
       Added new reporting form (--report-format=FORM) that
       very similar to rpm's output format for verification.

     * <swlist, swremove,>
       FIXED operation with mksh or pdksh as the shell command

     * <swinstall>
       FIXED support for catalog at location outside installed 
       root dir.  The starting current working directory for control
       scripts is now SW_ROOT

     * <lxpsf> (rpm translation>
       Fixed support of RPMTAG_DEFAULTPREFIX.
     
     * <lxpsf> (deb translation)
       Added support for xz compressed archives.

     * <lxpsf> (rpm translation>
       Many corner cases in RPM translation are now fixed. Translation,
       installation, and cross verification have been tested on many
       hundreds of packages (on CentOS release 6.5)


version 1.11 - Jim Lowe,  2011-04-23
* <swpackage>: FIXED a race condition resulting in a signing failure
* <lxpsf>: FIXED segfault when translating some .deb file
* <lxpsf>: added support .lzma compressed data files in a .deb file

Fixed defects in the error code paths of all the utilities
that occur when file system permissions deny success to an
installed catalog operation.

Re-wrote (and fixed) the synct_* routines used for reading installed
catalog data with an in-band EOF.  These routines could fail due to
certain data contents.

version 1.7 - Jim Lowe,  2010-12-18
* <swinstall>: FIXED a broken speed optimization
* <swlist>: FIXED crashes due to use of unsupported features.

* <swverify>: Now has a verification summary for installed software.

* the utilities now support an absolute path location for
the installed software catalog that is outside the target path.
This is specified by the file URL syntax: file:///absolute/path/name

* <swconfig>: swconfig is completed and enters Beta testing. 

* <swpackage>: Improvements to the ''exclude'' directive in a PSF file

* Many other fixes

version 1.4 - Jim Lowe,  2009-07-06

* Added support for decrypting/encrypting via gpg command

* Added support for LZMA compression.

* Fixed <swpackage> Now software_definitions in a PSF
are properly merged.

* Fixed <lxpsf> Now the contents of ./conffiles in .deb format package
are used to set the 'is_volatile' attribute.

version 1.3 - Jim Lowe,  2009-03-11

* Fixed <swverify>

* Fixed <swinstall>
Now permissions and ownerships of all created files are
determined from values of of the installed_software_catalog

version 1.2 - Jim Lowe,  2008-11-22

* Fixed <swverify>
Fixed false verification failure of installed software due to broken
detection of file digests in the INFO file.

* New Feature
Volatile files detected when translating slackware runtime packages.
swverify

* Fixed <swpackage>
Now file attributes explicitly set in a PSF file definition are properly
preserved and merged.  Duplicate file definitions in a PSF are properly
merged.

* New option
--dereference and --ignore-slack-install options added for
swverify

* New option
--justdb added for swinstall and swremove

* New option
--justdb added for swinstall and swremove

* New Default
Now the --pump-delay for swinstall (a bug work-around)
is zero (disabled) by default.

* New Feature
Now the owners and permissions of the installed
software catalog (usually /var/lib/swbis/catalog/) are used
for new file creation in the catalog.  This will allow
non-root access policy if desired.

version 1.1 - Jim Lowe,  2008-10-26

* Fixed false report of files missing for installed software
verification for some packages.
* added - swverify --system-info=NAME option
* added - swverify --catalog-info=NAME option
* Fixed compiler warnings when using gcc version >4.x

version 1.0 - Jim Lowe,  2008-10-08

* New capability:
swinstall now correctly supports the checkinstall script and
deselects with side-effects based on the scripts status.

* New capability:
all utilties: now all the distributed utilites will auto-detect
the POSIX shell and a tar reading utility. This eliminates knowing
about the remote hosts' provisioning.

* New capability:
swverify now verifies installed software

* New capability:
swpackage will now translate slackware binary packages
swpackage will now translate .deb format packages

RELEASE NOTES: 0.499  2006-08-02
Summary (0.483 -> 0.499):
-------------------------
This release adds features to swpackage for using gpg-agent
when signing packages.  Also features were added to enable
use of swign in an Automake rule.  Enhancements to swverify
were made to allow verification of a signed directory
exported from a SCM repository such as CVS.  The distribution
package is now a self-hosting example of using the swign
utility along with automake to create tar archive distributions
with an embedded GPG signature.  An unsafe use of gpg's exit
status by swverify was fixed.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.483  2006-02-18
Summary (0.474 -> 0.483):
-------------------------
Fixed a tar header name split problem in 'swpackage'.
Fixed use of 'distribution_*_directory' extended options
in swinstall and swcopy.  Fixed abnormal termination code
paths in swinstall to avoid leaving stranded processes.
Added preliminary support for software selections and
arch compatibility checks.  Fixes for the CYGWIN platform
were made which consisted of sleep() calls to slow down busy
wait loops.

RELEASE NOTES: 0.474  2005-11-05
Summary (0.463 -> 0.474):
-------------------------
A problem with Explicit file definitions in a PSF when
using the "-t d" was fixed.  A long standing mis-use of
vsnprintf was fixed which fixed a segfault on a ppc64
GNU/Linux platform.  There were documentation and example
file updates.  swpackage was optimized and now 20% faster
for large packages.

RELEASE NOTES: 0.464  2005-09-26
Summary (0.446 -> 0.464):
-------------------------
Fixes were made to swpackage and its explict file 
definition processing for definitions without a source
file.  Fixes and changes were made to code sections used
during RPM translation.  Fixes were made to the
documentation.  Development and code cleanups begun
in several new areas.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.456  2005-05-21
Summary (0.446 -> 0.456):
-------------------------
Portability fixes were made to the build system.
For swpackage, file descriptor availability is now
verfied to prevent possible circumvention of file
descriptor leak checks that were already in place.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.446  2005-05-08
Summary (0.420 -> 0.446):
-------------------------
For swinstall, support was added for post, pre and check
install control script execution.  Fileset state transition
as well as script exit status recording is now implemented.
For swpackage, the ustar format is changed to be identical to
GNU tar 1.15.1.  Improvements to RPM translation were made,
including support for configuration file preservation.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.426  2004-12-23
Summary (0.420 -> 0.426):
-------------------------
Added a tar verbose listing to swpackage and swinstall, and
an extra verbose listing that shows the owner id and owner
name.  Fixed  the system database uid/gid and owner/group
name lookup mechanism which improves the sanity of PSF's
which specify owners/groups that are not present on the
packaging host.  In swpackage, fixed the lack of exec bit
for directories included by a recursive file extended definition.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.420  2004-11-14
Summary (0.415 -> 0.420):
-------------------------
Improvenments to swpackage's handling of duplicate
file definitions in a PSF.  Fixed a use of uninitialized
pointer which will either be harmless or cause an internal 
error hard exit.  Fixed swinstall's warning messages when
comparing file stats in the the INFO file to the storage
archive file stats.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.415  2004-10-27
Summary (0.411 -> 0.415):
-------------------------
Improvenments to swpackage's handling of duplicate
file definitions in a PSF.  RPM translation was fixed
which was broken in version 0.410.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.411  2004-10-04
Summary (0.405.1 -> 0.411):
-------------------------
The swpackage exclude keyword processing was fixed.
Minor fixes to swinstall were made.  swverify's
exit status when checking installed software was fixed.
Setting extendeded options on the command line
was fixed for swcopy and swinstall.  A texinfo manual
was created.

RELEASE NOTES: 0.405.1  2004-06-23
Summary (0.405 -> 0.405.1):
-------------------------
Fixed swverify(8) option processing.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.405  2004-06-17
Summary (0.371 -> 0.405):
-------------------------
A swinstall core dump was fixed.
Swbis' RPM installation/translation support is now built-in
by the inclusion of rpmlib, derived from rpm-3.0.5 (RH-6.2).
Swinstall is now more usable, although control script
execution is *still* not done.  Fixes were made to swpackage
and swinstall for user/group names not in the system database,
and for pathnames with non-ascii chars.  Swinstall now works with
HP-UX depot packages.  Swinstall now imposes the file meta-data
from the INFO [per spec].  Swinstall and RPM translation has been
tested on Sparc/SunOS, x86/NetBSD, and many Linux versions.  These
fixes produce 100% success rate for translating/installing RPMs
from RH8.0 (although the postinst and preinst scrripts are not yet
run) and other vendor's RPMs appear to work as well.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.370  2004-05-23
swbis-0.370.tar.gz 72d6d93f3014a17eed3418d011355489

-------------------------
Swinstall is now more usable, although control script
execution is *still* not done.  Minor fixes to swpackage.
RPM translation was improved and integrated into swinstall
and swcopy.  swinstall should be considered _alpha_,
however, with implementation of INFO file meta-data checks,
file md5 checks, and direct comparison of RPM and
swinstall installs possible as a test, a measure of
correctness can be demonstrated for swinstall. 

RELEASE NOTES: 0.343  2004-04-22

--------
Several bugs in swpackage related to hard link handling were
fixed.  Enhancements and fixes to swpackage and swign were

all around.  swinstall remains in _alpha_ release state.

RELEASE NOTES: 0.314  2004-02-22
Summary:
--------
Changed the form of the installed software catalog so that
gpg(1) can be used directly to verify an installed signed
package.  The '-r' swinstall option is now implemented.
The -t type option of an explicit file extended definition
in a PSF file was fixed.


RELEASE NOTES: 0.308  2004-02-17

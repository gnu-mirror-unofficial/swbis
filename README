Introduction
------------
  swbis is a software administration system for GNU/Linux systems and
  systems that are UNIX system-like. It implements the Open Group's CAE
  Spec C701 (XDSA) Distributed Software Administration.  This spec
  closely follows ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999 (now withdrawn) which was
  identical to IEEE 1387.2:1995.  The implementation relies on POSIX
  functionality as provided by a typical GNU system.  It has security
  enhancement extensions that use GNU Privacy Guard.  Although swpackage
  is a self-contained tar writing utility and swinstall will use generic
  tar for file loading, several features are based on bit-for-bit
  sameness with the GNU tar POSIX tar interchange format and other GNU
  tar features, hence, GNU tar is a special tool requirement to access
  the full features of swbis.
 
  Its package management features are unique. It is network transparent,
  and requires no new programs, services, or configuration on the remote
  target host. It connects to remote hosts using the stock system ssh
  client program and executes the POSIX shell which must be one of
  /bin/bash, /bin/ksh (public domain, recent AT&T ksh93, or mksh), or
  OpenSolaris /usr/xpg4/bin/sh.  It connects to POSIX shell via its
  standard input using its unique ability to read shell program code
  and data on stdin.  File loading (for installation) is performed by
  the system tar (/bin/tar) command.
  
  It is back compatible with the tar archive format and typical file
  layouts for source and run-time packages.  Its security features include
  multiple embedded package signatures and MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 digests
  for the payload and individual files.  The package management utilities
  can operate locally or from a central host to a heterogeneous collection
  of remote U*IX-Like hosts with supported checks for reinstall, downdate,
  compatibility and prerequisites.

  In addition to package management, there are several other applications
  of the package management utilities:  Format translation of RPM and
  dpkg packages (swpackage), data copying from host to host (swcopy),
  creation of tar archive distributions from a detailed recipe file
  (swpackage and swign), and the ability to sign a directory and verify
  it thus to act as a directory content integrity checker (swign and
  swverify).
  
    * ISO/POSIX Utilities (location: <prefix>/bin) :

       swcopy - Distribution copying utility.
       swpackage -  Packages files according to a PSF file.
       swverify -  Authenticates a signed package.
       swinstall  -  Install a posix package
       swlist  -  List the catalog
       swremove  -  Remove installed software
       swconfig -  Configure installed software
 
    * Non-POSIX (Ad Hoc) Utilities (location: <prefix>/bin) :

       swign   -  Signs a directory by loading the ./catalog/ directory
                  into the current directory.

    * Non-POSIX Library Utilities (location: <libexecdir>/swbis) :
           (et.al., others not mentioned)

       swbistar - write a tar archive (not used by any utility)
       swbisparse - parse INFO, INDEX, and PSF files (not used by
                  any utility)
       lxpsf   -  The first step translator for RPM,deb packages
                  (used by swpackage when translating).
       arf2arf - Internal Library interface utility to extract and
		  verify the signed and digested byte streams. (used
                  by swverify)
       iswverify - swverify helper, used by swverify  

 
Requirements
------------
    Compilation:
    ------------

    GNU make is required and zlib.a
    With these satisfied swbis should compile on almost any
    GNU/Linux or BSD host.
    
    For Use (in general):
    ---------------------

    To support complete functionality of the utilities, /bin/bash (or
    public domain ksh as /bin/ksh) and GNU tar as /bin/tar (or as
    /bin/gtar with special options) are required.  For verification and
    signing GNU gpg is required.   GNU tar is only required when using
    the 'swign' utility or certain features of swlist, in other contexts
    'pax' or 'tar' can be specified for archive reading and writing.
    GNU tar can be installed as /bin/gtar with appropriate changes to
    the 'swbisdefaults' configuration file.

    For further details on the shell requirement and a strategy for host
    compatibility: 

        see swbis(7) : LANG=C nroff -man <doc/man/man7/swbis.7 | less -r

    For use on BSD and UNIX systems:
    --------------------------------

    Out-of-the box BSD systems are supported.
    Compile like this:  (you need GNU make)

         POSIXSHELL=/bin/ksh ./configure && gmake

         Note: The POSIX shell need not be /bin/sh, /bin/sh on BSD
               systems works fine.

    For the shell requirement, public domain ksh works fine and is probably
    present on BSD systems, set the 'swbis_shell_command' option in 
    $HOME/.swbis/swbisdefaults or /usr/lib/swbis/swbisdefaults.

         swbis_shell_command = detect # {bash|ksh|sh|detect}

   (Note: AT&T'93 ksh does not have the required POSIX feature and will not
          work.  It will be detected and not used however).

    This will auto detect bash or ksh or /bin/sh if suitable.  'detect' is
    the builtin default setting for all the utilities and it will allows
    universal operability to remote UNIX, BSD and GNU/Linux hosts.
    
          swbis_no_getconf = true
          swbis_shell_command = detect

    For swlist and swverify, set the 'write' pax command to 'detect'.  This
    will cause 'pax' to be used instead of the system tar which on BSD does not
    have the required special feature.  If GNU tar is present on all your hosts
    specify it if you wish.

          swlist.swbis_local_pax_write_command = detect
          swverify.swbis_remote_pax_write_command = detect

          swbis_local_pax_write_command = detect
          swbis_remote_pax_write_command = detect
          swbis_local_pax_read_command = tar # {tar|pax|gtar}
          swbis_remote_pax_read_command = tar # {tar|pax|gtar}

KNOWN BUGS
----------
    SWINSTALL with a Linux kernel and OpenSSH sshd (Extremely Rare)
    -------------------------------------------------------------- 
         (August 2008:  This seems to be fixed by OpenSSH 5.1p1)

    It seems that swinstall with certain packages when accessing
    a Linux kernel host via OpenSSH sshd (using ssh protocol v2) will fail.
    When the failure occurs the swinstall will give a message like:

    swinstall: Warning: 30 NUL blocks at start of input for task Catalog directory removal
    tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
    tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
    swinstall: SWI_TASK_ENDS on target host low20.lowland.com: load fileset: status=2
    swinstall: SW_SOC_LOCK_REMOVED on target host low20.lowland.com: status=0
    swinstall: SW_SESSION_ENDS on target host low20.lowland.com: status=1
    swinstall: error loading fileset
    swinstall: SWBIS_TARGET_ENDS for @localhost:/tmp/aabbxx: status=1

    A subsequent (immediate) retry may succeed, in fact the failure
    may be reproducable only 1 time out of 20 or 30 attempts but only for
    that particular package.  Another package may never exibit the bug.  It
    seems dependent on CPU and network speed, and I/O pattern, and CPU load.
    The probablility of failure increases if a multi-hop ssh target is used
    such as   swinstall [...] @ localhost:localhost:localhost:/tmp/xxtest
    which chains together three sshd servers.

        Work-Arounds
        ------------
        Try one of the following:
        1)  Run the exact command again, it will probably work.
        2) --burst-adjust=8000 --pump-delay=100000 # add a 100000 nanosec
                                                   # delay every 8000 bytes
        Investigators may try:
        3) --ssh-options=1                # Use ssh protocol version 1
        4) --remote-shell=rsh             # Use rsh
           
    It has *never* been seen on a BSD kernel, nor for local installs [that
    do not use ssh], nor when using rsh instead of ssh.  It can be exibited
    with a single host using localhost and and a ssh OpenSSH
    server 4.x - 5.x versions.

    This bug was first noticed in 2004 on a 2.4.x kernel, OpenSSH v3.9 may
    mask the occurance.

      [Update --- August 2008]
      -----------------------
      OpenSSH 5.1p1 seems to make this problem disappear.
      The issue probably involved the "error fd race" which
      was claimed to be fixed in this release.  This makes sense
      since swinstall (and all swbis utilities) make unusual heavy
      use of stdout, stdin, and stderr at the same time.  Also in
      SSH protocol v2, the stderr fd was relegated to a separate
      internal mechanism whereas in protocol v1 they were implemented
      symmetrically.  This might explain why the BUG does not appear
      when using protocol v1.

    AWK
    ---
    The awk code in swsupplib/shell_lib/shell_lib.sh trips a bug in
    /usr/xpg4/bin/awk on Solaris hosts (OpenSolaris build 54) when using
    relops (applied to revision numbers) in selections. Replacement
    of /usr/xpg4/bin/awk with gawk, mawk, or awk (the awk-book awk
    from AT&T) fixes the problem. A work-around to allow all awks
    to work has not been devised.
    For example:
        # swlist --products as1\*,r\>1.0 
    lists nothing,
    but replacing awk properly lists the catalog entry:
        as10k1                  r=1.0.8         v=1mdk

    All distributed SW<utilities>
    -----------------------------   
    If you hit ctrl-c during a remote install, stranded shell processes
    and its sshd parent might be left running on the target host.
    To clean this up, do:
         swremove --cleansh @ USER@HOST    # i.e. Same USER and HOST

    SSH Oddities and Observations
    -----------------------------
    Problems were observed when running swinstall on a SunOS host
    (SunOS sparc-solaris1 5.9) using the Sun ssh client (Sun_SSH_1.0)
    The problem only affected installs to remote hosts and seemed to
    go away if an OpenSSH ssh client was used instead of Sun's.

How to install
--------------
    Simply,

	./configure && make

    See the file INSTALL for more details.
 
To make the autotools
--------------------
 aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake

To make under a different revision
----------------------------------
	# Example
	sh bin/reversion.sh 1.0.10a
	./configure && make && make distclean

Debugging and Hacking
---------------------

   Make program execution verbose:
   -------------------------------

   Add verbose switches, up to ten (10)
   may have increasing effect, for example
                 swcopy  -vvvvvv
   -x verbose=8  , same as -vvvvvvvvv
   -v
   --debug-verbose 
   --debug-events  Show the internal events listing to stderr
   --swi-debug-name=NAME  write a ascii dump of the the internal package object


   Inspect the scripts that are generated
   --------------------------------------

   Try these options:

   --debug-task-scripts   write the individual task scripts to files in /tmp
   --source-script-name=NAME  write the main script to NAME.
   --target-script-name=NAME  write the main script to NAME.
                              NAME may be a number, for example 2 meaning stderr

   The --debug-task-scripts option fills /tmp with files like:
        /tmp/swbis_task_load_control.sh
        /tmp/swbis_task_Remove_catalog_entry
        /tmp/swbis_task_Make_catalog_entry_directory
        /tmp/swbis_task_Lock_Session

   To run a task script manually from the command line for testing,
   you must provide input it expects, scripts which do not receive input
   always will read one block of data.

      For example:

       (cat  /tmp/swbis_task_Remove_files; dd if=/dev/zero count=1) |
       (cd / && bash -s -vx ) 1>/tmp/xxout 2>&1


   Turn on Debugging statements
   ----------------------------
   
   Define this at the top of every file .c or .cxx on a
   file-by-file basis:

       #define FILENEEDDEBUG 1

   Then recompile.  This turns on E_DEBUG statements that appear
   in source code as:

       E_DEBUG("msg");
       E_DEBUG2(format, arg1);   /* like sprintf, fprintf, etc */
       E_DEBUG3(format, arg1, arg2);


   Turn on older (deprecated, maybe broken) debugging statements
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
        See  include/debug_config.h

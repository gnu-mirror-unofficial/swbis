<P>
<b>swbis</b> is a software administration system for GNU/Linux systems and systems that are UNIX system-like.
It implements the Open Group's CAE Spec C701 (XDSA) Distributed Software Administration.
This spec closely follows ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999 (now withdrawn)
which was identical to IEEE 1387.2:1995.
The implementation relies on POSIX functionality as provided by a typical GNU system.
It has security enhancement extensions that use GNU Privacy Guard.
The scope of the spec includes a package format, meta-data file format,
and utilities for package creation, installation, query, listing, and verification.

<P>
While the swbis system has features comparable with package managers, it has
features that are of general purpose usefulness to system administrators and
developers.  These include host-to-host copying of file system directories,
advanced tarball creation methods, backward compatibility with uses of plain tarballs,
and the ability to act as a directory content integrity checker.

<P>
A notable feature of the swbis implementation is its Distributed Software Administration
capability.  All utilties (except swpackage) are network transparent via direct
use of the system Ssh client program.  In addition, no new programs or services are
required on remote target hosts.  This is achieved by use of the ``bash -s'' invocation
of a POSIX shell on the remote host which allows reading of script and data on standard input.
File loading is performed by 'tar'.

<P>
In addition, the swbis swpackage utility is able to translate other package formats
into a swbis package with metadata and embedded GPG signature.  Translation is
done in memory without using temporary files.
Currently .rpm, .deb, and slackware runtime packages and plain tarballs are supported.

<P>
Some of the programs supplied with this package are:
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swpackage_8.html">swpackage</A> - Create packages.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swcopy_8.html">swcopy</A> - Copy packages, either in archive or directory form.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swconfig_8.html">swconfig</A> - Configure packages.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swinstall_8.html">swinstall</A> - Install packages.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swlist_8.html">swlist</A> - List installed software.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swremove_8.html">swremove</A> - Remove installed software.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swverify_8.html">swverify</A> - Verify packages using the embedded GPG signature.
<LI><A HREF="/software/swbis/swign_1.html">swign</A> - Create a signed package of a directory, for example a source directory.

<dt>09 October 2008: <b>Swbis 1.0 Released</b></dt>

<dl>
<dt>12 August 2008: <b>Swbis 0.986 Released</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> <b>Version 0.986 is feature complete for upcoming 1.0 release</b>
<p>
Changes in this release include:
<ul>
<li>Autodetection for the shell and tar programs. Now, a single configuration works for BSD and GNU/Linux hosts with
their stock provisioning.
<li>Improved support for hosts that lack bash and GNU tar.
<li>Fixed support for UTF-8 filenames.
<li>Many other fixes.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>18 April 2008: <b>Swbis 0.951 Released!</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> <b>Version 0.951 is feature complete for upcoming 1.0 release</b>
<p>
Changes in this release include:
<ul>
<li>Support for translating dpkg and slackware binary packages.
<li>Support for translating plain source tarballs to an equivalent package
    with meta-data and embedded signature.
<li>Support for verifying installed software.
<li>New distributed utilities <em>swlist</em> and <em>swremove</em>.
<li>Support for sha512 digests.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>15 September 2007: <b>swlist and swremove now available</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> The latest version of Swbis available via anonymous CVS now includes new distributed utilties
swremove and swlist.
<p>
To get the latest use:
<pre>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/swbis export -D 2037-01-01 swbis
</pre>
The resulting directory can be verified using swverify like this:
<pre>
swverify -d --scm @:swbis
</pre>
This should authenticate the GPG signature but some files may have different md5/sha1 digests
because the ./catalog directory is not resigned for every CVS commit.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>05 August 2006: <b>Swbis 0.499 Released!</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> The latest version of Swbis, version 0.499, is available.
<p>
Changes in this release include:
<ul>
<li>New Automake support for building file releases with an embedded GPG signature.
<li>New support for adding GPG signatures to CVS (or any SCM) repositories.
</ul>
See the
<A HREF="/software/swbis/sourcesign-1.2/gendocs/manual/index.html">tutorial</A>
for details of these new features.
<p>
The CVS Repository contains the 0.499 release that has been signed. To get it use:
<pre>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/swbis export -r release_0_499 swbis
</pre>
Then use swverify (version 0.499) to verify it.  A directory named <tt>swbis</tt> will have been created:
<pre>
swverify -d --scm @:swbis
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

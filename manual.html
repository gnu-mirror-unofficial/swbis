<h2 class="chapter">1 Creating Signed Distributions</h2>

<p>The first step in package signing is to obtain GNU Privacy Guard and its command line program
<samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp>.  The next step is to invoke it directly to test your gpg configuration. 
The <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> program is invoked by <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> with the following options:

<pre class="verbatim">
      gpg --no-tty --no-secmem-warning --armor --passphrase-fd 3 -sb -o -
</pre>

   <p>The <samp><span class="option">--passphrase-fd</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--no-tty</span></samp> options would not be used if running the <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> utility
from the command line. 
The option swpackage <samp><span class="option">--gpg-name</span></samp> option maps to gpg <samp><span class="option">--local-user</span></samp> option and
the swpackage <samp><span class="option">--gpg-path</span></samp> option maps to gpg  <samp><span class="option">--homedir</span></samp> option.  The default id to
sign and home directory depends on <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp>'s defaults, the default home directory is
is usually <samp><span class="file">~/.gnupg</span></samp>.

   <p>If you experience difficulty signing a test file using <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> then consult the gpg manual,
since configuring <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> is outside the scope of swbis.

   <p>Once you know <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> works without signing enabled simply invoke it
with the additional option <samp><span class="option">--sign</span></samp> and possibly <samp><span class="option">--gpg-name=YOUR_ID</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--gpg-path=PATH</span></samp>.  <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> should ask for your passphrase. Note that
the <samp><span class="option">--sign</span></samp> turns on <samp><span class="option">--archive-digests</span></samp> automatically since a package
is not fully verifiable without archive digests.

   <p>Other <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> options you may which to use are <samp><span class="option">--files</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--file-digests</span></samp>.

   <p>For example:
<pre class="verbatim">
        swpackage -Wsign,files,gpg-name="Test User" -s PSF @- >/dev/null
</pre>

   <p>There are defaults file options which can be set to your preferences.  The command line options always
override the the defaults file settings.

<pre class="verbatim">
     swpackage.swbis_file_digests       = "true"   # true or false
     swpackage.swbis_files              = "false"   # true or false
     swpackage.swbis_sign               = "false"   # true or false
     swpackage.swbis_gpg_name           = 
     swpackage.swbis_gpg_path           = "~/.gnupg"
     swpackage.swbis_signer_pgm	        = "GPG"
</pre>

   <p>In addition, signed packages can be created using the ad-hoc extension
utility <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp>.  It was designed especially to create signed POSIX
packages of free software source packages.

   <p>The operational constraints for using <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> are that every file
in the current directory is packaged, all files have the same ownerships,
the archive will have a single leading package directory equal to the current
directory name, and the package will contain the <samp><span class="file">catalog</span></samp> directory. 
Other than the additional <samp><span class="file">catalog</span></samp> directory, the package can be
identical to the non-POSIX package created with <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>.

   <p><samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> is designed to be fail safe. <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> uses <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>
and GNU <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> as tools in a fashion such that all data copied to the user is
generated by GNU <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> from a file list generated by <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>. 
Therefore, there is no chance the archive is corrupt, and because of sanity checks on
the file list using existing GNU file system utilities, little to no chance of missing
data.

   <p><samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> requires GNU <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> version 1.13.25 or 1.14 or 1.15.x. 
Using a version other than these will produce a valid archive, but the signature
may not be valid.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating a signed POSIX archive</h3>

<p><samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> packages all the files in the current directory, makes
the path name prefix the name of the current directory, and all the files
will have the same ownerships.  These constraints are suited to GNU and
Unix free software source packages.

   <p>Creating a signed package with <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> is
easy. Just change directory to the directory you want to archive,
verify the documented side-effect of removing and replacing a
directory name <samp><span class="file">catalog</span></samp> is not a problem.  If your directory
has a file named catalog (that is not a POSIX exported catalog) that
belongs to your data set you must rename it.  For better or worse
'catalog' is a keyname of the POSIX standard.

   <p>Then type:

<pre class="verbatim">
       swign -o 0 -o 0 --show-psf 
                 -or- 
       swign --show-psf 

</pre>
to show the internally PSF to stdout.  It tries to make a reasonable PSF
using the name of the current directory.  You can supply you own PSF from
a file or on standard input like this

<pre class="verbatim">
       swign -o 0 -o 0 --show-psf  | swign -s - --show-psf

</pre>
Now, make a package for real.

<pre class="verbatim">
       swign -o 0 -o 0 --show-psf  | swign -u "My GPG Name" @- >../my_new_signed_tarball

</pre>
<samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> writes to stdout. 
You must redirect the archive to a more useful file.

   <p>You could verify it like this:
<pre class="verbatim">
       swign -u "My GPG Name" @- | swverify -d @-
               -or like this-
       swverify -d @:../my_new_signed_tarball

</pre>

   <p>If a <samp><span class="file">checkdigest</span></samp> script is included then you should unpack the package at
a new location and run  'swverify &ndash;checksig "."' in the new location.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating a signed directory</h3>

<p>Creating a signed directory is actually the first step that
<samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> does when creating a signed archive. Using
the <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp> simply causes <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> to exit early.

   <p>Aside:
<pre class="verbatim">
      This feature exposes a regression test constraint, namely
      that the byte stream generated by 'swpackage' and installed
      by 'tar' is identical to the byte stream generated by GNU 'tar'
      from the newly installed 'catalog' directory.
</pre>

   <p>To sign the directory, and then verify it:
<pre class="verbatim">
       swign -S; swverify -d @.
</pre>

   <p>This produces the output:
<pre class="verbatim">
    swign: Generating the catalog and installing with tar...   
    swpackage: Warning: exclude definition source [catalog] does not exist.
    Enter Password: 
    swverify: GPG signature verified.
    swverify: checkdigest script not found
    swverify: Package authenticity not confirmed.
</pre>

</pre>
See <a href="swverify.html#Verifying-the-Directory-Form-of-a-Distribution">(swbis_swverify)Verifying the Directory Form of a Distribution</a>.

   <p>Swign can be used to sign any directory using the  file  ownerships  of
the  source files.  The following commands act as a test of swpackage's
ability to generate an archive identical to  GNU  tar. 
(Note:  checkdigest.sh is found in ./bin of the source distribution.)

      swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u "Test User" -o "" -g "" -S;

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Providing a <samp><span class="file">checkdigest</span></samp> script</h3>

<p>The <samp><span class="file">checkdigest</span></samp> script is a distributor extension script.  Only the swbis
implementation of <samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp> knows how to use it. 
An example file is found in the swbis source package.

   <p>You need to supply a checkdigest script only if you wish your customers to be
able to verify the directory form (i.e. unpacked archive) of a POSIX package. 
There are constraints on the usefulness of this script which are the
same as when attempting to verify manually. 
See <a href="swverify.html#Verifying-a-POSIX-Distribution-Directory-Manually">(swbis_swverify)Verifying a POSIX Distribution Directory Manually</a>. 
It is not used when verifying the archive file form.  Also, since it
should only use non-swbis standard GNU tools and is a shell script,
it does not do anything that the end user could not do themselves.

   <p>The script is included in the package one of two ways: using the <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> option of the
<samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> command or by specifying in a PSF to be processed by <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>. 
The syntax for referencing from a PSF is:
<pre class="verbatim">
      checkdigest &lt; /path/name/to/your/checkdigest.sh
</pre>

   <p>This line should be added in the distribution object of the PSF.

<h2 class="chapter">2 What features are working?</h2>

<p>In summary, the swbis supports network-transparent package management
but is restricted to packages with a single fileset and product.  It has
utilities for stand-alone creation of tarballs with meta-data including
embedded GPG signatures.  There exists also the ability to translate dpkg, rpm, and
slackware directly into POSIX format

   <p><samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> is the most complete utility. It implements all
of the ISO/IEC 15068-2 features of the Product Specification File,
the input file of <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>.

   <p><samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> can create POSIX tar archives with a POSIX
file layout with an embedded GPG signature and
payload digest (md5 and sha1).  This capability is
mature and safe, but for those who are paranoid about
using a new tool to create archives of your data, there
is <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp>. <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> signs the current working directory, presumably
a directory containing your source tree, and then uses <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> to emit the archive. 
The result is a package, created by GNU tar, which looks like a
source tar archive with a leading directory.  The archive has
the ./catalog/ directory which contains the package metadata,
GPG signature and digests which are stored as separate regular files,
and as ascii text of course.

   <p>Below is more detail about current capabilities.

     <ul>
<li>Installing POSIX packages

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp>

     <li>Copying POSIX packages

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp> is missing many features specified in the POSIX
spec.  Several degenerative basic features work and can be useful. 
It can unpack compressed tar archives handling compression transparently. 
It can copy directories from host to host. 
It can be used as a copying tool for arbitrary data, however this is not
its intended application.  Unfortunately, many of its intended uses don't
work yet.

     <li>Handling RPM Packages

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp>  or <samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp> can translate RPMs to a tar archive.  This is useful for
installing the contents of a source RPM into a single directory.

     <p><samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp> can install a RPM as a POSIX package (i.e by translating
first).

     <li>Package Creation

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> is at a beta release level.  It supports
all Product Specification File (PSF) features in the IEEE spec.

     <li>Package Verification

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp> is used to verify the payload digests and
GPG signature (if any) of a POSIX package (i.e. tar archive in POSIX format). 
<samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp> also is used for verification of installed software.

     <li>Package Removal

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swremove</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swremove</span></samp> is used to remove installed software.

     <li>Package Listing

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swlist</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swlist</span></samp> is used to list information about the installed software.

     <li>Package Configuration

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swconfig</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swconfig</span></samp> is used to configure installed software.  It
provides a stand-alone execution interface to the package configure scripts.

     <li>Creating GPG Signed Source Packages.

     <p>Command: <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp>

     <p><samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> is a ad-hoc implementation extension utility.

     <p><samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> is used to create a GPG signed POSIX package
from the contents of the current directory.  The intended use
is for creation of signed source tar archives.

     <p>It is a shell script that uses <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> and
GNU <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>.  Since the created archive is written to
stdout by GNU <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> and makes sanity checks using
standard utilities it is safe to use.

<h2 class="chapter">3 How to invoke swbis</h2>

<p><a name="index-sample-1"></a><a name="index-invoking-_0040command_007bswbis_007d-2"></a>
The utilities are invoked from the command line.

   <p>The commands share a common syntax that is:
<pre class="verbatim">
       &lt;sw_utility> [options] [software_selections] [@Targets]
</pre>

   <p>The current swbis utilities are <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp>.

   <p>A central element of all the commands is the target syntax. See <a href="#Target-Syntax">Target Syntax</a>.

   <p>Here are several rules worth remembering about the Target:
     <ul>
<li>The '@' is required exactly once even
when there are multiple targets. 
<li>Multiple targets are separated by whitespace. 
<li>A simple name is assumed to be a host name unless it begins
with a '/' in which case it is assumed to be a path on the local host. 
The POSIX standard requires the target path be an absolute path.  The
swbis implementation relaxes this somewhat for remote host operations. 
That is, when a HOSTNAME is given the path may be relative and if so
is relative to the login directory for the user [according to how the
remote host and ssh are configured].

     <p>If the target path is not given for a remote target, the target path
is either '.' or '/' depending on the utility and the defaults files. 
(The default target path for <samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp> is always '/')

     <li>The Target Syntax can be applied to the source.  The source is
specified by the -s option.

     <li>The swbis implementation supports a '-' as a target meaning stdin/stdout,
as well as a '.' meaning the current directory.

   </ul>

   <p>Here are several example of Targets:
     <ul>
<li>remote host with a different user:
<pre class="verbatim">     
          @ root@host1
</pre>

     <li>Two hop target with different user on each host and
a path specification on the terminal host:
<pre class="verbatim">     
          @ root@host1@@guest@host2:/tmp/mnt/test
</pre>

     <li>home directory of the user on host1
<pre class="verbatim">     
          @ user@host1:.
</pre>

     <li>file named file1 in current directory
<pre class="verbatim">     
          @ :file1     # Impl Extension
</pre>

   </ul>

   <p>The command <samp><span class="command">swbis</span></samp> can be used to invoke
the swbis utilities. 
The <samp><span class="command">swbis</span></samp> command is useful if the utilities are not installed in $PATH. 
Alternatively, individual utilities can be invoked by themselves.

   <p>Here are some example invocations:

     <ul>
<li>
     <pre class="example">          swbis --version
     </pre>
     <li>
     <pre class="example">          swbis --help
     </pre>
     <li>Create a signed tar archive descibed by the PSF <samp><span class="file">/tmp/mypsf</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          swpackage --sign --gpg-name="Your GPG Identity" --format=ustar -s /tmp/mypsf  &gt;/tmp/foo.tar
     </pre>
     <li>Verify a signed distribution:
     <pre class="example">          swverify -d @/tmp/foo.tar
     </pre>
     <li>Install a package from stdin to <samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          swinstall -s -
     </pre>
     <li>Translate an RPM format package to POSIX format:
     <pre class="example">          swcopy -s /tmp/myrpm.rpm --audit --allow-rpm @- | tar tvf -
     </pre>
     <li>Create a signed archive of <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          swign -u "Your GPG Identity" @- | tar tvf -
     </pre>
     </ul>

            | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':'
            | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING 
            | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING 
            | ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING   # Impl extension
            ; 

       PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING must be an absolute path unless
                       a HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is given.  Allowing
                       a relative path is a feature of the swbis
                       implementation.

                NOTE: A '.' as a target is an implementation
                      extension and means extract in current
                      directory.
 
                NOTE: A '-' indicating stdout/stdin is an 
                      implementation extension.

                NOTE: A ':' in the first character indicates a filename.
                      This is an implementation extension.

       HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is an IP or hostname.

    Examples:
       Copy the  distribution /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz at 192.168.1.10
              swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz @192.168.1.10:/root

<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h4>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with...Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

NAME
       swpackage -- Package a software distribution.

SYNOPSIS
       swpackage    # Filter: read PSF on stdin, write a tar archive to stdout

       swpackage -s- @-	 # Absolutely explicit, same as above

       swpackage @/dev/null   # Useful for debugging

       swpackage  [-p]	[-s psf_file]  [-f file] [-x option=value] \
       [-X options_file] [-W option] [software_selections] [@targets]

       swpackage  [options] --to-swbis [-s package_file]   # format translator

DESCRIPTION
       swpackage reads a Product Specification File (PSF) and writes a
       distribution to the specified target.  If no options are given a PSF is
       read on stdin and a distribution is written to the default target
       either a directory, device, or standard output.	To specify standard
       output use a dash '-' as the target.  This implementation only supports
       writing to stdout.

OPTIONS
       software_selections
	      Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) on which to
	      be operated. (Not yet implemented)

       targets
	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  To specify standard output use a  dash '-',
	      this overrides media_type setting to 'serial'.  Target may be a
	      file system directory, or device file or '-' Currently this
	      implementation only supports a serial archive written to stdout.

       -f FILE
	      Reads software_selections from FILE. (Not implemented).

       -p
	      Preview the package.  Perform all the packaging operations
	      except writing the target.  In verbose level 1, nothing is
	      written.	Higher verbose levels write information on stdout.
	      Error and warning messages are written to stderr for verbose
	      levels 1 and higher.


       -s PSF
	      Specify the PSF file, "-" is standard input.

       -x option=value
	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       -X FILE
	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       -v
	      (Implementation extension.) Given one time it is identical to -x
	      verbose=2.  This option can be given multiple times with
	      increasing effect.
		   level 0: silent on stdout and stderr (not implemented).
		   level 1: fatal and warning messages.
	      -v   level 2: level 1 plus file list and trailer message.
	      -vv  level 3: level 2 verbose tar-like listing.
	      -vvv level 4: level 3 extra verbose tar listing.

       -b BYTES
	      Set blocksize to BYTES number of bytes (octets).	The default is
	      10240.  (implementation extension)

       --version, -V
	      Show version. (Implementation extension)

       --help
	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]
	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       -W cksum
	      Compute POSIX cksum of the individual files.

       -W file-digests -W digests
	      Compute md5 digests of the individual files.  (-W digests is
	      deprecated, use -W file-digests).

       -W files
	      Store the distribution file list in .../dfiles/files.

       -W dir=NAME
	      Use NAME as the path name prefix of a distribution and also as
	      the value of the distribution.control_directory and
	      distribution.tag attribute (if not set).	May be set to an empty
	      string to eliminate stray leading "./".

       -W sign
	      Compute the md5sum, sha1sum and adjunct_md5sum digests and sign
	      the package.

       -W dummy-sign
	      Same as -W sign except use a dummy signature.  The signer
	      program is not run and no password is required.

       -W signer-pgm=SIGNER
	      Recognized SIGNERs are GPG, PGP2.6, and PGP5.  swverify only
	      supports GPG, however, other types can be verified manually
	      using the options of swverify and command line utilities.

       -W archive-digests
	      Compute the md5sum, sha1sum and adjunct_md5sum digests.  See
	      sw(5) for info on the digest and signed data input files.	 The
	      sha1sum and md5sum attributes have identical input streams.

       -W no-sha1
	      Do not compute the sha1 digest even if directed to by other
	      options.	(Deprecated: There is limited reason to use this
	      option).

       -W signed-file
	      Write only the signed data to the specified target but do not
	      sign.  (Deprecated: There is limited reason to use this option).

       -W gpg-name=NAME
	      Use NAME as the user ID to sign.	NAME becomes the option arg of
	      the gpg --local-user option.

       -W gpg-path=PATH
	      Use PATH as the gpg homedir.

       -W gzip
	      compress output with file system gzip utilty

       -W bzip2
	      compress output with file system bzip2 utility
       -W lzma
	      compress output with file system lzma utility

       -W symmetric
	      encrypt output with file system gpg utility

       -W encrypt-for-recipient=NAME
	      encrypt with NAME's public key using file system gpg utility


       -W source=FILE
	      Use serial archive located at FILE as the source instead of the
	      file system.  The files referred by the PSF are taken from the
	      serial archive and not the file system.

       -W numeric-owner
	      Same as GNU tar option.  Emitted archive has only uid and gids.

       -W absolute-names
	      Same as GNU tar option.  Leading slash '/' are always stripped
	      unless this option is given.

       -W format=FORMAT
	      FORMAT is one of:

	       ustar   is the POSIX.1 tar format capable of storing
		       pathnames up to 255 characters in length.
		       Identical to GNU tar 1.15.1 --format=ustar
		       This is the default format but may be changed by
		       the options files.
	       ustar0  is a different POSIX.1 tar personality.
		       Identical to GNU tar 1.13.25 --posix -b1 for 99 char pathnames
		       Has different rendering of device numbers for non-device files,
		       but otherwise identical to 'ustar'
	       gnu     Identical to GNU tar version 1.15.1 --format=gnu
	       oldgnu  Identical to GNU tar version 1.13 and later with
			   block size set to 1. i.e. with option -b1.
		       Also identical to GNU tar 1.15.1 --format=oldgnu
	       gnutar  same as oldgnu, oldgnu preferred.
	       pax     Extended header tar (Not implemented).
	       odc     Posix.1 cpio (magic 070707).
	       newc    cpio format (magic 070701).
	       crc     cpio format (magic 070702).
	       bsdpax3 Identical to pax v3.0, ustar format with option -b 512.


       -W create-time=TIME
	      Applies to catalog files and the create_time attribute.  TIME is
	      the seconds since the Unix Epoch.	 You must use this option to
	      make the catalog directory identical in subsequent (back-to-
	      back) invocations.

       -W list-psf
	      Write the PSF to stdout after having processed the extended
	      definitions.

       -W to-swbis
	      Read a package on standard input and write a POSIX package on
	      standard output.	Requires the .../libexec/swbis/lxpsf program.
	      Supported formats are any supported format of lxpsf.  Identical
	      to:
	      /swbis/lxpsf --psf-form3 -H ustar | swpackage -Wsource=- -s@PSF

       -W passphrase-fd=N
	      Read the passphrase on file descriptor N.

       -W passfile=FILE
	      Read the passphrase from FILE in the file system.	 Setting FILE
	      to /dev/tty resets (i.e unsets) all passphrase directives, thus
	      establishing the default action, reading from the terminal.

       -W dir-owner=OWNER
	      Set the owner of the leading directory archive member to OWNER.
	      If the option arg is "", then the owner is the owner of the
	      current directory.

       -W dir-group=OWNER
	      Set the group of the leading directory archive member to OWNER.

       -W catalog-group=GROUP
	      Set the group of the catalog section to GROUP.

PACKAGE SIGNING
       Support for embedded cryptographic signature.

   Description
       Package signing is accomplished by including, as a package attribute, a
       detached signature in the package metadata (the catalog section of the
       package).  The signed data is the catalog section of the package (see
       sw(5) for a description) excluding the signature files archive header
       and data.  The package leading directory that does not contain the
       /catalog/ directory in its name is not included in the signed stream.
       The signed stream is terminated by two (2) null tar blocks (which are
       not in the actual package file).	 The storage section (or payload) of
       the package is included in the signed data by computing its md5 and
       sha1 message digests and storing these as attributes in the catalog
       section.

   Signature Generation
       The signature is generated by the file system signing utility.
       Currently, swpackage supports GPG PGP-2.6 and PGP-5.  The default is
       GPG but can be selected using the -Wsigner-pgm command line option and
       the swpackage.swbis_signer_pgm defaults file option.  The options and
       program can the displayed with the -Wshow-signer-pgm option.  The
       options in each case produce a detached ascii-armored signature.	 The
       maximum length for the ascii armored file is 1023 bytes.

   Passphrase Handling
       The passphrase can be read from the tty, a file descriptor, and
       environment variable or the GNUpg passphrase agent.  These are
       controlled by the options or the environment variables SWPACKAGEPASSFD
       and SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE.	 Placing your passphrase in an environment
       variable is insecure but may be usefull to sign packages with a test
       key and later replace it [when on a different host for example].

SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
       swpackage does not perform verification of the embedded cryptographic
       signature, although, a description is included here for completness.

   Overview
       Verification requires verifying the payload section md5 and sha1
       message digests and then verifying the signature.  Naturally, it is
       required that the signed data include the payload messages digests.
       See swverify.

   Manual Verification
       Verification requires re-creating the signed and digested byte streams
       from the archive file.  This is not possible using any known extant tar
       reading utility because of a lack of ability to write selected archive
       members to stdout instead of installing in the file system; however,
       the swverify utility can be used to write these bytes streams to stdout
       allowing manual inspection and verification.  See swverify.

   Manual Verification Using Standard Tools
       Verification using standard GNU/Linux tools is possible if the archive
       is installed in the file system.	 Success depends on the following
       factors:

       1) The tar utility preserves modification times
	  (e.g. not GNU tar 1.3.19).
       2) The archive does not contain Symbolic Links
	  (see sw(5) for explanation).
       3) The file system is a Unix file system (e.g. ext2).
       4) The package was created using -Wformat=gnutar or, -Wformat=ustar
	  with no file name longer than 99 octets.

	Recreating the signed and digested byte streams is then accomplished
       using GNU tar and the file list stored in the
       &lt;path>/catalog/dfiles/files attribute file as follows:

       In this example, the package has a single path name prefix called,
       namedir and the file owner/group are root.  These restrictions are
       suited to source packages.
       Verify the signature:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \
	 namedir/catalog | gpg --verify namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature -

	If this fails try using GNU tar option --posix.	 If this fails then
       you are out of luck as nothing in the catalog section can be trusted.

       Verify the payload digests:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum
	 cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/md5sum

	Likewise for the sha1 digest.

       If the package has symbolic links, Verify the adjunct_md5sum:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
	 ( while read file; do if [ ! -h $file ]; then echo $file; fi done; )|\
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum
	 cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/adjunct_md5sum

	The symbolic link files must be verified manually by comparing to the
       INFO file information.

SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT
       The output format is either one of two formats specified in POSIX.1
       (ISO/IEC 9945-1) which are tar (header magic=ustar) or cpio (header
       magic=070707).  The default format of the swbis implementation is
       "ustar".	 The POSIX spec under specifies definitions for some of the
       ustar header fields.  The personality of the default swbis ustar format
       mimics GNU tar 1.15.1 and is designed to be compliant to POSIX.1.  The
       personality of the "ustar0" format mimics, for pathnames less than 99
       octets,	GNU tar 1.13.25 using the "-b1 --posix" options.  This bit-
       for-bit sameness does not exist for pathnames greater than 99 chars as
       swbis follows the POSIX spec and GNU tar 1.13.25 does not.  The
       "ustar0" ustar personality is deprecated.  It is only slightly
       different from 'ustar' in how device number fields are filled (with
       spaces, zeros or NULs) for non-device files.

       In addition the swbis implementation supports several other tar
       variants including bit-for-bit mimicry of GNU tar (1.13.25) default
       format which uses a non-standard name split and file type (type 'L').
       This format is known as '--format=oldgnu'.  Also supported is the gnu
       format of GNU tar 1.15.1 specified by '--format=gnu'

       The defacto cpio formats are also supported.  "new ASCII" (sometimes
       called SVR4 cpio) and "crc" cpio formats with header magic "070701" and
       "070702" respectively.

       Support for "pax Interchange Format" (Extended header tar) described in
       IEEE 1003.1-2001 under the "pax" manual page is planned.

       The entirety of the output byte stream is a single valid file of one
       the formats mentioned above.

       The swbis implementation writes its output to stdout.  The default
       output block size is 10240 bytes.  The last block is not padded and
       therefore the last write(2) may be a short write.  The selected block
       size does not affect the output file contents.

       The swbis implementation is biased, in terms of capability and default
       settings, to the tar format.  Package signing is only supported in tar
       format.

SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT
       The input file is called a product specification file or PSF.  It
       contains information to direct swpackage and information that is
       package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged into the global
       INDEX file].

       A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs) and
       Extended Definitions (described below).	An object keyword connotes a
       logical object (i.e. software structure) supported by the standard.  An
       object keyword does not have a value field after it, as it contains
       Attributes and Extended Definitions.  An attribute keyword conotes an
       attribute which is always in the form of a keyword/value pair.

       Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and are
       transferred into the INDEX file.	 Object keywords not recognized by the
       standard are not allowed and will generate an error.  Extended
       Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created
       by swpackage).  Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into
       object keywords (objects) and attributes recognized by the standard.

       Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the swbis
       implementation of swpackage.

       The file syntax is the same as a INDEX, or INFO file.  A PSF may
       contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended
       definitions.

       For additional information see
       XDSA C701 http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm, or
       sw manual page.

   EXTENDED DEFINITIONS
       A Product Specification File (PSF) can contain Extended Definitions in
       the fileset, product or bundle software definitions.  They would have
       the same level or containment relationship as a file or control_file
       definition in the same contaning object.

       Extended Definitions represent a minimal, expressive form for
       specifying files and file attributes.  Their use in a PSF is optional
       in that an equivalent PSF can be constructed without using them,
       however, their use is encouraged for the sake of brevity and
       orthogonality.

       The swbis implementation requires that no [ordinary] attributes appear
       after Extended Definitions in the containing object, and, requires that
       Extended Definitions appear before logically contained objects.	That
       is, the parser uses the next object keyword to syntacticly and
       logically terminate the current object even if the current object has
       logically contained objects.

   o  Extended Control File Definitions
	    checkinstall  source  [path]
	    preinstall	  source  [path]
	    postinstall	  source  [path]
	    verify	  source  [path]
	    fix		  source  [path]
	    checkremove	  source  [path]
	    preremove	  source  [path]
	    postremove	  source  [path]
	    configure	  source  [path]
	    unconfigure	  source  [path]
	    request	  source  [path]
	    unpreinstall  source  [path]
	    unpostinstall source  [path]
	    space	  source  [path]
	    control_file  source  [path]


       The source attribute defines the location in distributors's development
       system where the swpackage utility will find the script.	 The keyword
       is the value of the tag attribute and tells the utilities when to
       execute the script.  The path attribute is optional and specifies the
       file name in the packages distribution relative to the
       control_directory for software containing the script. If not given the
       tag value is used as the filename.

   o  Directory Mapping
	  directory  source  [destination]


       Applies the source attribute as the directory under which the
       subsequently listed files are located.  If destination is defined it
       will be used as a prefix to the path (implied) file definition.	source
       is typically a temporary or build location and dest is its unrealized
       absolute pathname destination.

   o  Recursive File Definition
	 file *


       Specifies every file in current source directory.  The directory
       extended definition must be used before the recursive specification.

   o  Explicit File Definition
	 file [-t type] [-m mode] [-o owner[,uid]] [-g group[,gid]] [-n] [-v] source [path]


       source


	      source defines the pathname of the file to be used as the source
	      of file data and/or attributes.  If it is a relative path, then
	      swpackage searches for this file relative to the the source
	      argument of the directory keyword, if set.  If directory keyword
	      is not set then the search is relative to the current working
	      directory of the swpackage utility's invocation.

	      All attributes for the destination file are taken from the
	      source file, unless a file_permissions keyword is active, or the
	      -m, -o, or -g options are also included in the file
	      specification.

       path

	      path defines the destination path where the file will be created
	      or installed.  If it is a relative path, then the destination
	      path of the of the directory keyword must be active and will be
	      used as the path prefix.	If path is not specified then source
	      is used as the value of path and directory mapping applied (if
	      active).

       -t type

	      type may one of 'd' (directory), or  'h' (hard link), or 's'
	      (symbolic link).

	      -t d  Create a directory.
	      If path is not specified source is used as the path attribute.

	      -t h  Create a hard link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

	      -t s  Create a symbolic link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

       -m mode

	      mode defines the octal mode for the file.

   o  Default Permission Definition
	 file_permissions [-m mode] [-u umask] [-o [owner[,]][uid]] [-g [group[,]][gid]]


       Applies to subsequently listed file definitions in a fileset.  These
       attributes will apply where the file attributes were not specified
       explicitly in a file definition.	 Subsequent file_permissions
       definitions simply replace previous definitions (resetting all the
       options).

       To reset the file_permission state (i.e. turn it off) use one of the
       following:
	   file_permissions ""
	    or the preferred way is
	   file_permissions -u 000

   o  Excluding Files
	  exclude source


       Excludes a previously included file or an entire directory.

   o  Including Files
	  include &lt;filename


       The contents of filename may be more definitions for files.  The syntax
       of the included file is PSF syntax.


   SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS
       This section describes attribute usage and conventions imposed by the
       swbis implementation.  Not all attributes are listed here.  Those that
       are have important effects or particular interest.

   o Distribution Attributes
       The standard defines a limited set of attributes for the distribution
       object.	An expanded set is suggested by the informative annex however
       a conforming implementation is not required act on them.	 The reason
       for this is a distribution may be acted upon by a conforming utility in
       such a way that attributes of the distribution become invalid.  For
       this reason, some attributes that refer to an entire "package" [in
       other package managers] are referred from the product object and attain
       their broadened scope by the distributor's convention that their
       distribution contains just one product.

       For example, the package NAME and VERSION are referred from the product
       tag and revision, not the distribution's.  This convention supports
       multiple products in a distribution and is consistent with the
       standard.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the
	      distribution.  Providing a distribution tag is optional.	The
	      swbis implementation will use this as the [single] path name
	      prefix if there is no distribution.control_directory attribute.
	      A distribution tag attribute and swpackage's response to it is
	      an implementation extension.  The leading package path can also
	      be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.


       control_directory

	      control_directory, in a distribution object, is the constant
	      leading package path.  Providing this attribute is optional.  A
	      distribution control_directory attribute and swpackage's
	      response to it is an implementation extension.  The leading
	      package path can also be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.
	      This attribute will be generated by swpackage if not set in a
	      PSF.


   o Bundle Attributes
       A bundle defines a collection of products whether or not the
       distribution has all the products present.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the bundle.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  If it is not
	      present the product tag is used.


   o Product Attributes
       A product defines the software product.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the product.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  It is required.
	      The swbis implementation uses it in a way that is analogous to
	      the RPMTAG_NAME attribute, namely as the public recognizable
	      name of the package.


       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the distribution under which the
	      product contents are located.  This value has no affect on the
	      installed software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then
	      the tag is used.


       revision

	      Is the product revision.	It should not contain a "RELEASE"
	      attribute part or other version suffix modifiers.	 This value is
	      used by the swbis implementation as a path name component in the
	      installed software catalog.  It is required by swinstall.


       vendor_tag

	      This is a short identifying name of the distributor that
	      supplied the product and may associate (refer to) a vendor
	      object from the INDEX file that has a matching tag attribute.
	      This attribute is optional.  This attribute value should strive
	      to be unique among all distributors. The swbis implementation
	      modifies the intended usage slightly as a string that strives to
	      be globally unique for a given product.tag and product.revision.
	      In this capacity it serves to distinguish products with the same
	      revision and tag from the same or different distributor.	It
	      most closely maps to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or "debian_revision"
	      attributes.  It is one of the version distinguishing attributes
	      of a product specified by the standard.  It is transfered into
	      the installed_software catalog (not as a path name component) by
	      swinstall.  If this attribute exists there should also be a
	      vendor object in the PSF in the distribution object that has
	      this tag.	 This attribute is assigned the value of
	      RPMTAG_RELEASE by swpackage when translating an RPM.


       architecture

	      This string is one of the version attributes.  It is used to
	      disambiguate products that have the same tag, revision and
	      vendor_tag.  It is not used for determining a products
	      compatibility with a host.  The form is implementation defined.
	      swbis uses the output of GNU config.guess as the value of this
	      string.  A wildcard pattern should not be used.  The canonical
	      swbis architecture string can be listed with swlist. For example

	      swlist -a architecture @ localhost

	       Here are some example outputs from real systems.

		  System      `uname -srm`		architecture
	      Red Hat 8.0:  Linux 2.4.18 i686	     i686-pc-linux-gnu
	      OpenSolaris:  SunOS 5.11 i86pc	     i386-pc-solaris2.11
	      NetBSD 3.1:   NetBSD 3.1 i386	     i386-unknown-netbsdelf3.1
	      Red Hat 4.1:  Linux 2.0.36 i586	     i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1
	      Debian 3.1:   Linux 2.6.8-2-386 i686   i686-pc-linux-gnu



       os_name os_release os_version machine_type

	      These attributes are used to determine compatibility with a
	      host.  They correspond to the uname attributes defined by
	      POSIX.1.	If an value is nil or non-existent it is assumed to
	      match the host.  All attributes must match for there to be
	      compatibility.  Distributors may wish to make these values a
	      shell pattern in their PSF's so to match the intended collection
	      of hosts.	 swbis uses fnmatch (with FLAGS=0) to determine a
	      match.


   o Fileset Attributes
       A fileset defines the fileset.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the fileset.  It
	      is required although selection of filesets is  not yet supported
	      therefore the end user will have little to do with the fileset
	      tag.

       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the product under which the fileset
	      contents are located.  This value has no affect on the installed
	      software catalog.	 If it is not given in a PSF then the tag is
	      used.

   o Example Source Package PSF
       This PSF packages every file is current directory. It uses nil control
       directories so the package structure does not change relative to a
       vanilla tarball.

   o Example Runtime (Binary) Package PSF
       This is a sample PSF for a runtime package.  It implies multiple
       products (e.g. sub-packages) using the bundle.contents attribute.
       Since the bundle and product tags exist in a un-regulated namespace and
       are seen by end users they should be carefully chosen.	Note that the
       bundle and product have the same tag which may force downstream users
       to disambiguate using software selection syntax such as fooit,bv=* or
       fooit,pv=* .

RETURN VALUE
       0 on success, 1 on error and target medium not modified, 2 on error if
       target medium modified.

SIDE EFFECTS
	No temporary files are used in the package generation process.	When
       using the default target of stdout (directed to /dev/null), there are
       no file system side effects from swpackage.  GNU Privacy Guard (gpg)
       may alter its keys when invoked for package signing.

ENVIRONMENT
       SWPACKAGEPASSFD
	      Sets the --passphrase-fd option.	Set the option arg to a
	      integer value of the file descriptor, or to "env" to read the
	      passphrase from the environment variable SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE, or
	      to "agent" to cause gpg to use gpg-agent, or to "tty" to restore
	      default behavoir to reading passphrase from the terminal.


       SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE
	      Use the value as the passphrase if --passphrase-fd is set to
	      "env"


       GNUPGHOME
	      Sets the --gpg-home option.


       GNUPGNAME
	      Sets the --gpg-name option, which is turn set the --local-user
	      option of gpg.


REQUISITE UTILITIES
       Swpackage does not use any archive writing utilities, it has its own
       code to generate archives.
       Package signing uses one of the following:
	/usr/bin/gpg
	/usr/bin/pgp   (PGP 2.6.x)
	/usr/bin/pgps  (PGP 5)

       Swpackage will use /usr/bin/uuidgen if present to create the uuid.

BUGS
       A comment after an object keyword is wrongly not allowed by this PSF
       parser.	The --dir="" does not do what one would expect sometimes.  The
       output stream content is unaffected by the blocksize, that is the last
       write may be short write.  Signing is broken for cpio format archives.

NAME
       swinstall -- Install POSIX and RPM packages.

SYNOPSIS
       swinstall [-p] [-r] [-s source_file] [-f file] \
       [-t targetfile] [-x option=value]  [-X options_file] [-W option] \
       [software_selections] [@target [target1...]]

       swinstall -s -	 # Minimum unambiguous invocation.


DESCRIPTION
       swinstall installs a POSIX distribution from a source archive to a
       target directory.  A POSIX distribution is a package, typically a
       compressed tarball with metadata files in the prescribed file layout.
       Neither swinstall nor any component of swbis is required on the target
       host, however, the target host must look like a Unix system at the
       shell and command-line utility level and have a POSIX shell.  Remote
       network connections are made by ssh.  Ssh is the default but rsh can be
       selected by a command line option.

       By default and with no external influences (i.e. swdefaults file)
       swinstall will read an archive on stdin and install all products and
       filesets of package in "/" directory on the target host.	 An alternate
       root may be specified using the target syntax.  The distribution source
       directory (swbis default: stdin) is selectable via the defaults file,
       therefore it should be specified in uncontrolled environments.

       swinstall operates on  cpio or tar archives.  swinstall supports cpio
       archives by first translating to tar format, therefore, to reduce the
       data transformations performed by swinstall, distributors encouraged to
       deliver products in tar format.

       swinstall will create an entry in an installed software catalog.	 This
       is a directory usually located at /var/lib/swbis/catalog.  Using this
       information checks for upgrade, downdate, dependencies, and
       reinstallation are made.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE

	      Reads software_selections from FILE. (Not implemented).

       -p

	      Preview the operation.  Depending on the verbose level
	      information is written to stdout.	 The target is not modified
	      although a remote connection is established.


       -r

	      This option has no affect.


       -s SOURCE

	      Specify the source file SOURCE, "-" is standard input.  The
	      syntax is the same as for a target.  SOURCE may be an archive
	      file or stdin.

       -t targetfile

	      Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).

       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       -v

	      Given one time it is identical to -x verbose=2.  This option can
	      be given multiple times with increasing effect.  (Implementation
	      extension option).
	      -v  is level 2, -vv is level 3,... etc.
		  level 0: silent on stdout and stderr.
		  level 1: fatal and warning messages to stderr.
	      -v  level 2: level 1 plus a progress bar.
	      -vv level 3: level 2 plus script stderr.
	      -vvv level 4: level 3 plus events.
	      -vvvv level 5: level 4 plus events.
	      -vvvvv level 6: level 5 plus set shell -vx option.
	      -vvvvvv level 7 and higher: level 6 plus debugging messages.

       --version, -V

	      Show version (Implementation extension)

       --help

	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       -W preview-tar-file=FILE

	      This is a testing/development option.  Writes the fileset
	      archive to FILE.	This is the same data stream that would have
	      been loaded on the target.  This option should only be used with
	      the '-p' option.	The output sent to FILE is a tar archive but
	      without trailer blocks.

       -W remote-shell=NAME


	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_shell_client

	      This is the remote connection client program on the management
	      (originating host).  The path NAME may be an absolute path (not
	      located in $PATH).  The basename of NAME is used for
	      intermediate hops.  Supported shells are "ssh" and "rsh".	 The
	      default is "ssh".

       -W quiet-progress

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_quiet_progress_bar Disable progress
	      bar, which is active for verbose levels 2 and higher (i.e. -v).

       -W show-options-files
	      Show the complete list of options files and if they are found.

       -W show-options
	      Show the options after reading the files and parsing the command
	      line options.

       -W pax-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the portable archive command for all operations.  The
	      default is "pax".

       -W pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the read command for local and remote hosts.

       -W remote-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_read_command
	      Set the read command for remote hosts.  This is the command that
	      runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
	      "pax".

       -W local-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_read_command
	      Set the read command for local hosts.  This is the command that
	      runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
	      "pax".

       -W pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Set the write command for local and remote hosts.	 This is the
	      command that runs on the target (e.g. pax -w, tar cf -).

       -W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the write command for remote hosts.

       -W local-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for local host
	      operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
	      pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is "pax".

       -W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for remote host
	      operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
	      pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is "pax".

       -W no-defaults
	      Do not read any defaults files.

       -W no-remote-kill
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_no_remote_kill
	      Disables the use of a second remote connection to tear down the
	      first in the event of SIGINT or SIGTERM or SIGPIPE.  Only has
	      effect if the number of ssh hops is greater than 1.  A single
	      host remote connection (ssh hop = 1) never uses a second remote
	      connection.

       -W no-getconf
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_no_getconf
	      Makes the remote command be '/bin/sh -s' instead of the default
	      'PATH=`getconf PATH` sh -s'.

       -W shell-command=NAME
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_shell_command
	      This is the interactive shell on the target host.	 NAME may be
	      one of "detect" "bash", "sh", "ksh"  or "posix" and specifies
	      the remote command run by the remote shell.  "posix" is
	      'PATH=`getconf PATH` sh -s', "bash" is "/bin/bash -s", "sh" is
	      "/bin/sh -s", and "ksh" is "ksh -s".  The default is "detect".

       -W use-getconf
	      Opposite of --no-getconf.

       -W allow-rpm
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_allow_rpm
	      Enable automatic detection, translation to POSIX format, and
	      installation of RPMs.

       -W pump-delay1=NANOSECONDS
	      Adds a NANOSECONDS delay (999999999 nanoseconds ~ 1 second)
	      every ADJSIZE bytes in the file data byte pump.  A delay of
	      10111000 nanoseconds (~1/100th second) is added for 2-hop or
	      greater target (i.e more than 1 remote host in the target spec).
	      This is a work around for a bug in OpenSSH [or Linux kernel]
	      that is seen for multi-hop installs where the intermediate host
	      is a Linux kernel.  If 2-hop install fails, try it again, you
	      may get lucky, or, increase this delay, or, use ssh protocol
	      version 1 by using ''--ssh-options=1'', or try a 2-hop install
	      where the middle host is BSD.  To disable delay for multi-hop
	      targets specify zero.  For more information about this bug see
	      the README file from the source distribution.

       -W burst-adjust=ADJSIZE
	      ADJSIZE is the pumped data size, in bytes, between the
	      NANOSECONDS delays.  This is a work around for a bug in OpenSSH
	      or the Linux kernel that is seen for multi-hop installs where
	      the intermediate host is a Linux kernel.	The default is 72000
	      for 2-hops or greater, and zero for single hop and localhost
	      installs.

       -W ssh-options=OPTIONS
	      ssh client program options.  For example -W ssh-options=1 sets
	      the '-1' ssh client option which specifies protocol version 1.

       -W source-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       -W target-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       software_selections

	      Refers to the software objects (products, filesets) on which to
	      be operated. This is not implemented, however, specification of
	      a location and qualifier are supported.  location allow
	      specification of a alternate relative root path within the
	      target path, and qualifier allows specification of a user-
	      selectable modifier.  For example:

	      swinstall q=exp @ 192.168.1.1  # Tag the package as experimental
	      swinstall l=/unionfs/somepackage-1.0 @ 192.168.1.1  # Allows multiple
					    # packages with same tag to exist in the
					    # same target path, where the location
					    # disambiguates.



       target

	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
	      where the software collection is to be located.  A target that
	      contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
	      interpretation as a path, use an absolute path or prefix with
	      ':'.  The default target path for 'swinstall' is always '/'.


       Source and Target Specification and Logic

	    Synopsis:
		 Posix:
		      host[:path]
		      host
		      host:
		      /path  # Absolute path

		 Swbis Extension:
		      [user@]host[:path]
		      [user@]host_port[:path]
		      :path

		 Swbis Multi-hop Target Extension:
		      # ':' is the target delimiter
		   # '_' delimits a port number in the host field

		      [user@]host[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]
		      [user@]host_port[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]

		      # Using ':', a trailing colon is used to
		      # disambiguate between a host and file.
		   # For Example,
		      :file
		      host:
		      host
		      host:file
		      host:host:
		      host_port:host_port:
		      host:host:file
		      user@host:user@host:
		      user@host:user@host:host:
		      user@host:user@host:file

	    A more formal description:

	    target : HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':'
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING   # Impl extension
		   ;

	      PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING must be an absolute path unless
			      a HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is given.	 Allowing
			      a relative path is a feature of the swbis
			      implementation.

		       NOTE: A '.' as a target is an implementation
			     extension and means extract in current
			     directory.

		       NOTE: A '-' indicating stdout/stdin is an
			     implementation extension.

		       NOTE: A ':' in the first character indicates a filename.
			     This is an implementation extension.

	      HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is an IP or hostname.

INSTALLATION
       Installation consists of an analysis phase and an execution phase.

   Analysis Phase
       The installed software catalog is queried and checks are made to detect
       reinstallation, downdating (installing an older version).  Dependency
       tests are made at this point.  If these checks pass or are overridden
       by options, then the installed software catalog entry is created
       (moving the old entry).	The checkinstall script is exectuted.  This
       script should be non-interactive, idempotent, and read-only from the
       system's perspective.  This script may exit with status of 0,1,2, or 3.
       If the exit status is 3 (or 1) installation is rejected and the
       installed catalog is restored.

   Execution Phase
       The preinstall script is executed, the fileset files are loaded by the
       system tar utility and postinstall is executed.

INSTALLED SOFTWARE CATALOG
       The form or format of an installed software catalog is not specified by
       the ISO/IEC spec although it does specify an interface to it (e.g.
       swlist utility) and operations on it.

       This implementation creates a de-facto installed software catalog
       rooted at the file system path specified by the value of the
       installed_software_catalog extended option.  The catalog is a file
       system hierarchy containing regular files and directories.

       The catalog is typically located relative to the target path.  As of
       swbis version 1.5, the catalog location may be specified using the file
       URL syntax to indicate an absolute path.	 Any other form, such as an
       unadorned absolute UNIX path will be treated as a path relative to the
       target path.

       For Example:
       Below are example values of the installed_software_catalog extended
       option found in the swdefaults file usually located in
       $HOME/.swbis/swdefaults


	  var/lib/swbis/catalog	  # Default, relative to target path

	  /var/lib/swbis/catalog  # Same, leading slash not respected

	  file://localhost/var/lib/swbis/catalog  # Really absolute

	  file:///var/lib/swbis/catalog		  # Note triple leading slash

	&lt;path>/&lt;ISC>/&lt;bundle>/&lt;product>/&lt;pr>/&lt;sequence_number>/qualifier


       &lt;path> is the target path.  &lt;ISC> is the value of the
       installed_software_cataglog extended option.  &lt;bundle> and &lt;product>
       are bundle and product tags.  If there is no bundle in the distribution
       the product tag is used.	 &lt;pr> is the product revision.	Other items
       are explained below.

   CATALOG LOCATION
       /&lt;path>/
       /&lt;path>/&lt;installed_software_catalog>/
       /&lt;path>/&lt;installed_software_catalog>/...


       * Root or Alternate Root
       /&lt;path>/

       &lt;path>/ is the target path specified in the target syntax. By default
       "/".

       * Catalog Relative Root Directory
       /&lt;path>/
       /&lt;path>/&lt;installed_software_catalog>/

       &lt;installed_software_catalog>/ is the value of the extended option by
       the same name.  By default "var/lib/swbis/catalog".

   PACKAGE CATALOG RELATIVE ROOT
       /&lt;{bundle|prod}.tag>/&lt;prod.tag>/&lt;prod.revision>/...

	In other words, if 'product' and 'bundle' refers to tags, and
       product_revision is the value of the product.revision attribute then
       the path segment is:

	/bundle/product/product_revision


   CATALOG SEQUENCE NUMBER
	/&lt;sequence_number>/
	/&lt;sequence_number>/...


       sequence_number is a decimal integer starting with '0'.	It is chosen
       by swinstall to be unique at the time of installation.

   CATALOG CONTENTS
       &lt;sequence_number>/
	&lt;sequence_number>/export/
	&lt;sequence_number>/export/catalog.tar
	&lt;sequence_number>/export/catalog.tar.sig
	&lt;sequence_number>/INSTALLED
	&lt;sequence_number>/control.sh
	&lt;sequence_number>/session_options
	&lt;sequence_number>/vendor_tag
	&lt;sequence_number>/location
	&lt;sequence_number>/qualifier


       The export directory
	export/
	export/...
	export/catalog.tar
	export/catalog.tar.sig
	export/catalog.tar.sig2
		      ...
	export/catalog.tar.sigN


       The export/ is a file system directory and its name is constant for all
       packages and is unique to the swbis implementation.  The
       export/catalog.tar file is the signed file from the POSIX distribution.
       The export/catalog.tar.sig file is the signature file from the
       distribution.  If there is more than one signature, then it is the last
       one.  export/catalog.tar.sig2 is the next to last signature, and
       export/catalog.tar.sigN is the first one, where N is the total number
       of signatures.

       INSTALLED -- The state metadata file
	&lt;sequence_number>/INSTALLED


       The INSTALLED file is similar to an INDEX file in its grammar and
       syntax.	Unlike an INDEX file, it may contain control_file definitions.
       The INSTALLED file stores the control script return codes and fileset
       installation state.  It is updated several times during the operation
       of 'swinstall'.	It can be parsed using	libexec/swbisparse and the
       '--installed' option.

       control.sh -- The master control script
	&lt;sequence_number>/control.sh
	 SYNOPSIS: control.sh tag_spec script_tag


       The control.sh file is a POSIX shell script that is automatically
       generated by swinstall.	It provides a common interface for control
       script execution.  Its primary purpose is to set up the script's
       execution environment and map script tags to the control script
       pathnames.  It assumes that 'export/catalog.tar' is unpacked in
       export/.

       session_options -- The extended options
	&lt;sequence_number>/session_options


       This file contains the extended options in a form that may be executed
       by the shell '.' (dot) command.	It is automatically generated by
       swinstall.  The value of the SW_SESSION_OPTIONS environment variable is
       the absolute pathname of the this file.

   EXAMPLE CATALOG ENTRY
       Below is an example entry of the catalog created by swbis version
       0.405.  In this example, the target path is '/mnt/test', the
       installed_software_catalog is '/var/lib/swbis/catalog/', the bundle tag
       is 'foobare', the product tag is 'foobare-doc', and the product
       revision attribute is '0.902'.

       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/export
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/export/catalog.tar
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/export/catalog.tar.sig
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/INSTALLED
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/control.sh
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/vendor_tag
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/location
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/qualifier
       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/0/session_options

	A deleted old catalog entry begin with '_', for example

       /mnt/test/var/lib/swbis/catalog/foobare/foobare-doc/0.902/_0/...


       Although swinstall does not depend on the file name as this
       accommodates installing from standard input, a typical name for this
       package would be:

	      foobare-doc-0.902-sl04.tar.gz

	where 'sl04' is the vendor tag.

IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSIONS
   Software Specification Targets
       A dash '-' is supported and means stdout or stdin.  Operations with
       stdout and stdin on a remote host is not supported.

       A decimal '.' is supported and means the current directory.  This is
       supported for remote and non-remote targets.  If the source is standard
       input, the distribution will be unpacked (e.g. pax -r) in the directory
       '.'.  If the source is a regular file then a regular file in '.' will
       be created with the same name.


   RPM Translation
       RPM (RedHat Package Manager) format packages are installed by first
       translating to an equivalent ISO/IEEE file layout in POSIX tar format
       and then installing as a POSIX package.	This translation and detection
       is transparent to the user if the ''--allow-rpm'' option is set in the
       command line args or the swbis_allow_rpm is set to "true" by the
       defaults files, otherwise an error occurs.

       Since translation is done on the local (management) host, RPM is not
       required on the remote (target) host.

       The translation is (internally) equivalent to :

	  cat your-0.0-1.bin.rpm |
	  /usr/lib/swbis/lxpsf --psf-form2 -H ustar |
	  swpackage -W source=- -s @PSF | swinstall -s - @/


   Testing with RPM
	To test the swbis components, a completely independent means to
       install and verify a package is needed.	RPM provides this means and
       can be used in the following way:

	  rpm -i --nodeps --force your-0.0-1.i386.rpm  # Install
	  rpm --verify --nodeps your-0.0-1	       # Show that all is well
	  rpm -e --nodeps your-0.0-1		       # Remove it.
	  rpm -i --nodeps --justdb your-0.0-1.i386.rpm # Install just the database.
	  rpm --verify --nodeps your-0.0-1	       # Shows the files are missing.
	  swinstall --allow-rpm -s - &lt; your-0.0-1.i386.rpm
	  rpm --verify --nodeps your-0.0-1	       # Show that all is well again


EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Extended options can be specified on the command line using the -x
       option or from the defaults file, swdefaults.  Shown below is an actual
       portion of a defaults file which show default values.

   POSIX
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swdefaults or the
       ~/.swdefaults


	 allow_downdate		     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 allow_incompatible	     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 ask			     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 autoreboot		     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 autorecover		     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 autoselect_dependencies     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 defer_configure	     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 distribution_source_directory	 = -	    # Stdin
	 enforce_dependencies	     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 enforce_locatable	     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 enforce_scripts	     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 enforce_dsa		     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 installed_software_catalog  = var/lib/swbis/catalog
	 logfile	     = /var/lib/sw/swinstall.log #Not Implemented
	 loglevel		     = 0	  # Not Implemented
	 reinstall		     = false	  # Not Implemented
	 select_local	   = false	# Not Implemented
	 verbose	   = 1


   Swbis Implementation
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swbisdefaults or the
       ${HOME}/.swbis/swbisdefaults file.


	 swinstall.swbis_no_getconf = true # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_shell_command = detect # {detect|sh|bash|ksh|posix}
	 swinstall.swbis_no_remote_kill = false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_no_audit = false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_quiet_progress_bar = false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_local_pax_write_command=pax #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swinstall.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=pax #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swinstall.swbis_local_pax_read_command=pax #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swinstall.swbis_remote_pax_read_command=pax #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swinstall.swbis_enforce_sig=false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_enforce_file_md5=false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_allow_rpm=false # true or false
	 swinstall.swbis_remote_shell_client=ssh
	 swinstall.swbis_install_volatile=true
	 swinstall.swbis_volatile_newname=     #empty string, e.g. ".rpmnew"


RETURN VALUE
       0 if all targets succeeded, 1 if all targets failed, 2 if some targets
       failed and some succeeded.

NOTES
	Multiple ssh-hops is an implementation extension.

REQUISITE UTILITIES
       The swbis distributed utilities require bash, public domain ksh, or
       ksh93 (version 2009-05-05), or Sun's /usr/xpg4/bin/sh to be present on
       the target host.	 If the swbis_shell_command extended option is set to
       'detect' you don't have to know which one is present, otherwise you may
       specify one explicitly.

       A POSIX awk is required, and with the ability to specify several
       thousand bytes of program text as a command argument.  GNU awk  works,
       as does the ATT Awk book awk, and the awk on BSD systems.  See the
       INSTALL file for further details regarding a small issue with the
       OpenSolaris (c.2006) awk.

BUGS
       swinstall is subject to breakage if a user's account on an intermediate
       (or terminal) host in a target spec is not configured to use a Bourne
       compatible shell. (This breakage may be eliminated by use of the --no-
       getconf option as explained above.)

       A multiple ssh hop source spec  (more than 1 remote host involved in
       the source transfer) upon a SIGINT may result in sshd and ssh processes
       being left on on the intermediate host(s), this despite, swinstall's
       action of sending a SIGTERM to the remote script's parent process.

       swinstall does not currently implement Software Selections, not fileset
       dependencies, and much more.  Only packages with one product and one
       fileset are supported.

NAME
       swremove -- Remove installed software

SYNOPSIS
       swremove	 [-d|-r] [-v] [-t targetfile] \
       [-x option=value]  [-X options_file]  [-W option] \
       [software_selections]  [@targets]

       swremove --cleansh [options] [@targets]


DESCRIPTION
       swremove removes installed software.  swremove is a distributed
       utility.	 Neither swremove nor any component of swbis is required on
       the target host, however, the target host must look like a Unix system
       at the shell and command-line utility level.  Remote network
       connections are made by ssh.  Ssh is the default but rsh can be
       selected by a command line option.

       swremove operates on installed software identified by a software
       selection and target.

OPTIONS
       -d

	      Specify the target is a distribution.

		     Note:  This is currently not supported by this
		     implementation.


       -f FILE

	      Read the list of software selections from FILE.


       -p

	      Preview mode, establish contact with target host, however,
	      modify nothing.


       -r

	      Indicates that the operation is on installed software at a
	      location indicated by the the target.

		     Note:  This is the default mode among -d and -r


       -t targetfile

	      Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).


       -v

	      Increment the verbose level.


       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.


       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       --help

	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.


       --allow-ambig

	      Allows swremove to act on all matching entries.  Without this
	      option a software selection that matches more than one installed
	      software entry is an error.


       --sig-level=N

	      Specify number of required GPG signatures, N equal to 0 means
	      don't require the catalog to be signed.


       --cleansh

	      Kill stray or zombied processes that match the pattern ``sh
	      -s.*_swbis''.  These may be caused by a distributed utility
	      segfaulting or a signal handling defect in the swbis utility.


       -W remote-shell=SHELL

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_shell_client
	      Supported shells are "ssh" and "rsh", ssh is the default.

       -W show-options-files
	      Show the complete list of options files and if they are found.

       -W show-options
	      Show the options after reading the files and parsing the command
	      line options.

       -W pax-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the portable archive command for all operations.  The
	      default is "pax".

       -W pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the read command for local and remote hosts.

       -W remote-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_read_command
	      Set the read command for remote hosts.  This is the command that
	      runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
	      "pax".

       -W local-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_read_command

	      "pax".

       -W pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Set the write command for local and remote hosts.	 This is the
	      command that runs on the target (e.g. pax -w, tar cf -).

       -W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the write command for remote hosts.

       -W local-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for local host
	      operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
	      pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is "pax".

       -W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for remote host
	      operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
	      pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is "pax".

       -W no-defaults
	      Do not read any defaults files.

       -W no-getconf

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_shell_command
	      NAME may be one of "bash", "sh" or "posix" and specifies the
	      remote command run by the remote shell.  "posix" is
	      'PATH=`getconf PATH` sh -s', "bash" is "/bin/bash -s", "sh" is
	      "/bin/sh -s", and "ksh" is "ksh -s".  The default is "posix".

       -W use-getconf
	      Opposite of --no-getconf.


       -W source-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       -W target-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       software_selections

	      Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) using
	      software spec syntax. (See sw(5) for syntax).


       target

	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
	      where the software collection is located.	 A target that
	      contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
	      interpretation as a path, use a absolute path or prefix with
	      ':'.

EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Extended options can be specified on the command line using the -x
       option or from the defaults file, swdefaults.  Shown below is an actual
       portion of a defaults file which show default values.

   POSIX
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swdefaults or the
       ~/.swdefaults on the local (management host, host where swremove is
       invoked).  These files on the target host are not used.


	 autoselect_dependencies       = false
	 distribution_target_directory = /
	 enforce_dependencies	       = false
	 enforce_scripts	       = true
	 installed_software_catalog    = var/lib/swbis/catalog/
	 logfile		       = /var/log/sw.log
	 loglevel		       = 1
	 select_local		       = true
	 verbose		       = 1


   Swbis Implementation
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swbisdefaults or the
       ~/.swbis/swbisdefaults file.


	  swremove.swbis_no_getconf = true # true or false
	 swremove.swbis_shell_command = posix # {sh|bash|posix|ksh}
	 swremove.swbis_no_remote_kill = false # true or false
	 swremove.swbis_local_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swremove.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|star|gtar}

	 swremove.swbis_remote_pax_read_command=tar #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swremove.swbis_local_pax_remove_command=tar
	 swremove.swbis_remote_pax_remove_command=tar
	 swremove.swbis_remote_shell_client=ssh
	 swremove.swbis_forward_agent=True
	 swremove.swbis_sig_level=0
	 swremove.swbis_enforce_all_signatures=false


RETURN VALUE
       0 if all targets succeeded, 1 if all targets failed or internal error,
       2 if some targets failed and some succeeded.

NOTES
	Multiple ssh-hops is an implementation extension.

REQUISITE UTILITIES
       The swbis distributed utilities require bash, public domain ksh, or
       Sun's /usr/xpg4/bin/sh to be present on the target host.	 If the
       swbis_shell_command extended option is set to 'detect' you don't have
       to know which one is present, otherwise you may specify one explicitly.

       A POSIX awk is required, and with the ability to specify several
       thousand bytes of program text as a command argument.  GNU awk  works,
       as does the ATT Awk book awk, and the awk on BSD systems.  See the
       INSTALL file for further details regarding a small issue with the
       OpenSolaris (c.2006) awk.

       GNU Privacy Guard, gpg is required for verification of package
       signatures.

       swremove uses rm and rmdir for file and directory removal.

       Other utilities required to be in $PATH on the remote host are: dd, pax
       (or tar|star|gtar), mkdir, echo, test, sleep, read (if not builtin).

BUGS
       swremove is subject to breakage if a user's account on an intermediate
       (or terminal) host in a target spec is not configured to use a Bourne
       compatible shell. (This breakage may be eliminated by use of the --no-
       getconf option as explained above.) swremove does not support rollback
       if an error occurs during processing.

NAME
       swcopy -- Copy POSIX and RPM packages.

SYNOPSIS
       swcopy [-p] [-s source_file] [-f file] [-t targetfile] \
       [-x option=value] [-X options_file] [-W option] \
       [software_selections] [@target [target1...]]


DESCRIPTION
       swcopy copies a POSIX distribution from a source archive or directory
       to a target archive directory.  Neither swcopy nor any component of
       swbis is required on the target host, however, the target host must
       look like a Unix system at the shell and command-line utility level.
       Remote network connections are made by ssh.  Ssh is the default but rsh
       can be selected by a command line option.

       Before and during data transfer to the target, the distribution is
       audited.	 Package auditing includes parsing the INDEX and INFO meta-
       data files.  The package pathnames are checked for consistency with a
       valid layout.  swcopy can be made to operate on arbitrary data or
       archives not in POSIX format by using the --no-audit option.  By
       default and with no external influences (i.e. swdefaults file) swcopy
       will read a archive on stdin and write an audited archive on stdout.
       The uncompressed audited output file will be identical to the
       uncompressed input file unless an error occurs.	Compressed archives
       that are audited will be re-compressed in the same format, however, the
       resulting file may not be identical to the input file (i.e. date,
       filename, and other stored data in the compressed format will be
       different).

       swcopy operates on serial archives (e.g. compressed tar archives) or on
       file system directories.	 It will attempt to preserve the form (archive
       or directory) and compression state of the source object.  An exception
       is "." as a target (See Implementation Extensions below).

OPTIONS
       -f FILE

	      Reads software_selections from FILE. (Not implemented).

       -p

	      Preview the operation. Information is written to stdout.	The
	      target is not written and no remote connections are established.


       -s SOURCE

	      Specify the source file SOURCE, "-" is standard input.  The
	      syntax is the same as for a target.  SOURCE may be a directory
	      or archive file.

       -t targetfile

	      Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).

       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       -v

	      Given one time it is identical to -x verbose=2.  This option can
	      be given multiple times with increasing effect.  (Implementation
	      extension option).
	      -v  is level 2, -vv is level 3,... etc.
		  level 0: silent on stdout and stderr.
		  level 1: fatal and warning messages to stderr.
	      -v  level 2: level 1 plus a progress bar.
	      -vv level 3: level 2 plus script stderr.
	      -vvv level 4: level 3 plus events.
	      -vvvv level 5: level 4 plus events.
	      -vvvvv level 6: level 5 plus set shell -vx option.
	      -vvvvvv level 7 and higher: level 6 plus debugging messages.
	       The progress meter is suppressed if swcopy is using stdout for
	      data.

       -b SIZE

	      Set block size, same as --block-size=N (Implementation extension
	      option).

       --version, -V

	      Show version (Implementation extension)

       --help

	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       -W no-audit

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_no_audit
	      Do not audit the transferred file.  This allows copying of
	      arbitrary data.

       -W audit

	      Do audit the transferred file.  Useful for overriding
	      swbisdefaults file.

       -W block-size=SIZE

	      SIZE is number of octets.

       -W login

	      Establishes a interactive shell on the (remote) target host.
	      Intended for debugging/verifying ssh operation.

       -W gzip

	      Compress output using gzip.

       -W bzip

	      Compress output using bzip2.

       -W extract

	      Install the source using the archive reading utility at the
	      target.

       -W create

	      Force copy as a tar archive

       -W no-extract

	      For installation to a file, not as a tar archive to be
	      extracted.

       -W pty

	      Do use pseudo-tty.  The system Ptys are only used for the
	      --login feature.	A warning is emitted to stderr which says that
	      the usage may be insecure.

       -W no-pty

	      Do not use pseudo-tty.  The system Ptys are only used by default
	      for the --login feature, otherwise they are not used and this
	      option would have no effect.  If ptys are used a warning is
	      emitted to stderr which says that the usage may be insecure.

       -W uncompress

	      Write output archive that is uncompressed.

       -W remote-shell=SHELL

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_shell_client
	      Supported shells are "ssh" and "rsh", ssh is the default.

       -W quiet-progress

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_quiet_progress_bar
	      Disable progress bar, which is active for verbose levels 2 and
	      higher (i.e. -v).

       -W show-progress

	      Enables progress bar.(i.e. -v).

       -W show-options-files
	      Show the complete list of options files and if they are found.

       -W show-options
	      Show the options after reading the files and parsing the command
	      line options.

       -W pax-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the portable archive command for all operations.  The
	      default is "pax".

       -W pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Set the read command for local and remote hosts.

       -W remote-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_read_command
	      Set the read command for remote hosts.  This is the command that
	      runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
	      "pax".

       -W local-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_read_command

	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the write command for remote hosts.

       -W local-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_local_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for local host
	      operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
	      pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is "pax".

       -W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_remote_pax_write_command
	      Set the portable archive write command for remote host

	      host remote connection (ssh hop = 1) never uses a second remote
	      connection.

       -W no-getconf
	      Defaults File Option: swbis_no_getconf
	      Makes the remote command be '/bin/sh -s' instead of the default

       -W source-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       -W target-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       software_selections

	      Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) on which to
	      be operated. (Not implemented).  The implementation defined
	      behavior for no selections is to operate on the entire
	      distribution.


       target

	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
	      where the software collection is located.	 A target that
	      contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
	      interpretation as a path, use a absolute path or prefix with
	      ':'.

       If a target directory on the host does not exist it will be created
       using mkdir -p using the file creation mask of the originating swcopy
       process.	 A trailing slash in the target spec signifies that the last
       path component should be a directory.  A source spec that is a
       directory will be created on the target as a directory with the same
       name in the target directory.  If the source spec is stdin then the
       existence of directories in the target spec and a trailing slash in the
       target spec path determines whether the created file will be a regular
       file or directory, that is, stdin will be copied as a file unless the
       last target path component is a directory or ends in a slash '/'.  If
       the source spec is a regular file, the source basename will be used as
       the basename in the target if the last target path component is a
       directory or ends in a slash '/', otherwise, the target basename is the
       last path component of the target spec.	The implementation option
       --extract biases these rules to install using the archive reading
       command (e.g.  pax -r).

   Examples
	      Copy a regular file via tar archive creation and extraction.
	      This will preserve the permissions of the file to the extent tar
	      can preserve them.

		swcopy --no-audit --create --extract -s :README @ HostA

	       Copy a directory to another host

		swcopy --no-audit  -s /usr @ HostA:/usr/local/tmp/HostA/

	       Copy several directories to another host as a compressed
	      archive file.

		  swcopy --no-audit --no-extract \
			   -s /usr -s /etc @ HostA:/tmp/usr-etc.tar.bz2

	       Install a tarball in the current directory: Note: Must use
	      stdin as source and "." as the target.

		   swcopy --no-audit -s - @. &lt; foo.tar.gz

	       Copy thru a firewall:

			  swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz \
			       @root@host1:root@host2:/var/tmp

	       Copy Stdin to a remote host:

		  Unpack the archive on stdin in the directory
		  /a/b/c if 'c' is a directory, otherwise copy
		  the archive file to a file named 'c' in
		  directory /a/b creating it if possible and
		  overwriting if required.
		      swcopy -s - @host1:/a/b/c

	       Copy Stdin to a remote host:

		     Unpack the serial archive on stdin in the
		     directory /a/b/c if 'c' is a directory,
		     otherwise make the directory 'c' but fail if
		     directory 'c' cannot be created.
			 swcopy -s - @host1:/a/b/c/
				   # Note trailing slash.

	       Copy a regular file:

		 Copy file yy to directory /aa/bb/cc/ on the
		 remote host, creating it if required and possible.
		 If cc is a regular file then fail.
		    swcopy -s /xx/yy @host1:/aa/bb/cc/

	       Copy a regular file thru intermediate host 'fw':

		     Copy file yy to home directory of user1 on host1
		     thru a an intermediate host fw,
			 swcopy -s /xx/yy @ fw:user1@host1:.

	       Copy a directory from one host to another

		     Copy directory yy into directory cc if cc exists,
		     otherwise create cc and copy yy into it. If cc
		     is and copy as yy.
			 swcopy -s /xx/yy @host1:/aa/bb/cc


IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSIONS
   Software Specification Targets
       A dash '-' is supported and means stdout or stdin.  Operations with
       stdout and stdin on a remote host is not supported.

       A decimal '.' is supported and means the current directory.  This is
       supported for remote and non-remote targets.  If the source is standard
       input, the distribution will be unpacked (e.g. pax -r) in the directory
       '.'.  If the source is a regular file then a regular file in '.' will
       be created with the same name.

       Thus,

		  # swcopy -s `pwd`/myarchive.tgz @.  # Do NOT do this even
						      # though in most cases
						      # swcopy is a coward.

	will destroy the source file myarchive.tgz, whereas

		  # swcopy -s - @. &lt;`pwd`/myarchive.tgz

	will install it with the configured archive reading utility.



   RPM Translation
       RPM (RedHat Package Manager) format packages are copied by first
       translating to an equivalent ISO/IEEE file layout in POSIX tar format
       and then copying as a POSIX package.  The RPM detection and translation
       occurs if the ''--allow-rpm'' option is on (either by the command line
       args or defaults file) and the ''--audit'' option is on.	 If the
       ''--allow-rpm'' option is not set an error occurs.  If the ''--audit''
       is not set, the RPM is copied as arbitrary data and translation does
       not occur.

       Since translation is done on the local (management) host, RPM is not
       reqired on the remote (target) host.

       The translation is (internally) equivalent to :

	  cat your-poor-poor-0.0.bin.rpm |
	  /usr/lib/swbis/lxpsf --psf-form2 -H ustar |
	  swpackage -Wsource=- -s@PSF


EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Extended options can be specified on the command line using the -x
       option or from the defaults file, swdefaults.  Shown below is an actual
       portion of a defaults file which show default values.

   Posix
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swdefaults or the
       ~/.swdefaults


	  autoselect_dependencies     = false	   # Not Implemented
	  compress_files	      = false	   # Not Implemented
	  compression_type	      = none	   # Not Implemented
	  distribution_source_directory	  = -
	  distribution_target_directory	  = -
	  enforce_dependencies	      = false	    # Not Implemented
	  enforce_dsa		      = false	    # Not Implemented
	  logfile		      = /var/lib/sw/swcopy.log #Not Implemented
	  loglevel		      = 1	   # Not Implemented
	  recopy		      = false	   # Not Implemented
	  select_local	       = false	    # Not Implemented
	  uncompress_files	       = false	   # Not Implemented
	  verbose		       = 1


   Swbis Implementation
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swbisdefaults or the
       ~/.swbis/swbisdefaults file.


	 swcopy.swbis_no_getconf = true # true or false
	 swcopy.swbis_shell_command = detect # {detect|sh|bash|posix|ksh}
	 swcopy.swbis_no_remote_kill = false # true or false
	 swcopy.swbis_no_audit = false # true or false
	 swcopy.swbis_quiet_progress_bar = false # true or false
	 swcopy.swbis_local_pax_write_command=pax #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swcopy.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=pax #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swcopy.swbis_local_pax_read_command=pax #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swcopy.swbis_remote_pax_read_command=pax #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swcopy.swbis_allow_rpm = false	 # true or false
	 swcopy.swbis_remote_shell_client=ssh


RETURN VALUE
       0 if all targets succeeded, 1 if all targets failed, 2 if some targets
       failed and some succeeded.

NOTES
	Multiple ssh-hops is an implementation extension.

REQUISITE UTILITIES
       The swbis distributed utilities require bash, public domain ksh, or
       Sun's /usr/xpg4/bin/sh to be present on the target host.	 If the
       swbis_shell_command extended option is set to 'detect' you don't have
       to know which one is present, otherwise you may specify one explicitly.

       A POSIX awk is required, and with the ability to specify several
       thousand bytes of program text as a command argument.  GNU awk  works,
       as does the ATT Awk book awk, and the awk on BSD systems.  See the
       INSTALL file for further details regarding a small issue with the
       OpenSolaris (c.2006) awk.

       Tar or pax is used for archive transfer.	 You may specify which one.

       swcopy.swbis_local_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|gtar}
       swcopy.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|gtar}

BUGS
       Swcopy is subject to breakage if a user's account on an intermediate
       (or terminal) host in a target spec is not configured to use a Bourne
       compatible shell. (This breakage may be eliminated by use of the --no-
       getconf option as explained above.)

       A multiple ssh hop source spec  (more than 1 remote host involved in
       the source transfer) upon a SIGINT may result in sshd and ssh processes
       being left on on the intermediate host(s), this despite, swcopy's
       action of sending a SIGTERM to the remote script's parent process.

       Swcopy does not currently implement Software Selections nor the events
       of the Selection and Analysis Phases nor dependency copying nor fileset
       state transitions.  The Execution (copying) phase is done on the entire
       distribution by the utility selected in .../swbisdefaults which is
       pax(1) by default.  Pax is not found on all GNU/Linux systems.  Also,
       the pax version shipped with some (older) GNU/Linux systems mangles the
       pathname of files whose pathname is exactly 100 octets long.  Despite
       this pax is the the builtin default.  GNU tar is widely used and
       trusted but creates non-standard archives for long pathnames.  Perhaps
       the best compromise is to use star (with -H ustar header option)	 for
       archive creation and (GNU) tar for archive reading.  If your
       environment is 100% GNU/Linux using GNU tar is safe (GNU tar 1.13.25 is
       recommended).  Swcopy does not support using the cpio utility since its
       archive writing interface is unlike pax and tar, although, future
       support is possible for archive reading.

NAME
       swlist -- List information about the software

SYNOPSIS
       swlist  [-d|-r] [-v] [-a attribute] [-l level]  [-t targetfile] \
       [-c file] [-x option=value]  [-X options_file]  [-W option] \
       [software_selections]  [@targets]

       swlist --products [software_selections]	[@targets]

       swlist --files  [@targets]

       swlist --dir [software_selections] [@targets]

       swlist --dependencies [--prerequisites sw_spec] \
       [--exrequisites sw_spec] [@targets]


DESCRIPTION
       swlist lists information about a distribution or installed software.
       Neither swlist nor any component of swbis is required on the target
       host, however, the target host must look like a Unix system at the
       shell and command-line utility level.  Remote network connections are
       made by ssh.  Ssh is the default but rsh can be selected by a command
       line option.

       swlist operates on serial archives (e.g. compressed tar archives) or on
       a file system directory representing installed software.	 The default
       target directory is '/', this default is subject to user configuration.

OPTIONS
       -a attribute

	      Specify an attribute to list.   Only the architecture attribute
	      is supported for installed_software at this time (MAR 2007).
	      The returned value is determined by running GNU config.guess on
	      the target host.


       -c FILE

	      Write the catalog to FILE. Software selections are applied.  The
	      only supported FILE is '-' causing a dump of the catalog to
	      stdout in tar format.


       -d

	      Specify the target is a distribution.


       -f FILE

	      Read the list of software selections from FILE.


       -l LEVEL

	      Specify a level to list. LEVEL is an enumerated list of objects:
	      bundle, product, fileset, control_file, file (Not yet
	      implemented)


       -r

	      Indicates that the operation is on installed software at a
	      location indicated by the the target.


       -t targetfile

	      Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).


       -v

	      List attribute value pairs in INDEX file format according to
	      attibutes specified by the -a option, list all attributes if -a
	      not used; or, increment the verbose level.

		     Note:  This option is overloaded. It means two different
		     things depending on the context.  If a mode is explicitly
		     given, then it means increment verbosity, otherwise it
		     means list in INDEX file format.


       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       --help

	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       --products

	      List the product's tag, revision, vendor_tag and location.

       --directory

	      List the catalog directory entries.

       --files

	      List files as defined in the installed catalog

       --sys

	      List files as exists in the file system

       --dependencies

	      Run in check dependency mode.  Assert dependencies against
	      installed software catalog. Dependencies are software specs
	      given by the --prerequisites and --extrequisites options


       --prerequisites=SW_SPEC

	      Specify depencency to check, may be used multiple times.
	      Prerequisites packages are required to be installed.


       --exrequisites=SW_SPEC

	      Specify depencency to check, may be used multiple times.
	      Exrequisites packages are required not to be installed.

       -W target-script-name=NAME
	      Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       software_selections

	      Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) using
	      software spec syntax. (See sw(5) for syntax).


       target

	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
	      where the software collection is located.	 A target that
	      contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
	      interpretation as a path, use a absolute path or prefix with
	      ':'.


       Source and Target Specification and Logic

	    Synopsis:
		 Posix:
		      host[:path]
		      host
		      host:
		      /path  # Absolute path

		 Swbis Extension:
		      [user@]host[:path]
		      [user@]host_port[:path]
		      :path

		 Swbis Multi-hop Target Extension:
		      # ':' is the target delimiter
		   # '_' delimits a port number in the host field

		      [user@]host[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]
		      [user@]host_port[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]

		      # Using ':', a trailing colon is used to
		      # disambiguate between a host and file.
		   # For Example,
		      :file
		      host:
		      host
		      host:file
		      host:host:
		      host_port:host_port:

	    A more formal description:

	    target : HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':'
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING   # Impl extension
		   ;

	      PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING must be an absolute path unless
			      a HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is given.	 Allowing
			      a relative path is a feature of the swbis
			      implementation.

		       NOTE: A '.' as a target is an implementation
			     extension and means extract in current
			     directory.

		       NOTE: A '-' indicating stdout/stdin is an
			     implementation extension.

		       NOTE: A ':' in the first character indicates a filename.
			     This is an implementation extension.

	      HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is an IP or hostname.

	   Examples:
	      Copy the	distribution /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz at 192.168.1.10
		     swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz @192.168.1.10:/root


       Implementation Extension Syntax (multi ssh-hop) :
	   Syntax:
	   %start   wtarget    # the Implementation Extension Target

IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSIONS
       The --dependencies, --products, and --files are implementation
       extension modes.


USAGE EXAMPLES
   Show the path of the installed software catalog.
	 swlist --show-options | grep installed_


   List Products
       * List products from a certain distributor, foo (Note:  this requires
       that the foo vendor uses foo_something_ as the product vendor_tag in
       their distributions.

	 swlist v="foo*"


       * List all products

	 swlist @/   # If distribution_target_directory=/ then "swlist" alone
		     # will suffice.


       * List products installed at alternate root

	 swlist @/mnt/test


       * List products according to a name pattern and revision, and
       distributor

	 swlist emacs"*","r>20",v=rh"*" @/



   Test Dependencies
       * Check if a given dependency passes against a given installed catalog
       on a host

	 swlist -x verbose=3 --depend --pre="foo*,r>=1.0,r&lt;2" @192.168.3.1:/; echo $?



EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Extended options can be specified on the command line using the -x
       option or from the defaults file, swdefaults.  Shown below is an actual
       portion of a defaults file which show default values.

       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swdefaults or the

RETURN VALUE
       0 if all targets succeeded, 1 if all targets failed or internal error,
       2 if some targets failed and some succeeded.  When checking
       dependencies, 3 if the given sw_specs failed as dependencies, 0 if
       succeeded.

NOTES
	Multiple ssh-hops is an implementation extension.

REQUISITE UTILITIES
       The swbis distributed utilities require bash, public domain ksh, or
       Sun's /usr/xpg4/bin/sh to be present on the target host.	 If the
       swbis_shell_command extended option is set to 'detect' you don't have
       to know which one is present, otherwise you may specify one explicitly.

       A POSIX awk is required, and with the ability to specify several
       thousand bytes of program text as a command argument.  GNU awk  works,
       as does the ATT Awk book awk, and the awk on BSD systems.  See the
       INSTALL file for further details regarding a small issue with the
       OpenSolaris (c.2006) awk.

       Tar or pax is used for internally for data transfer.  You may specify
       which one.  swlist and swverify require either GNU tar or pax be
       present on a host.  You may set auto detection for this requirement

       swlist.swbis_local_pax_write_command=detect #{pax|tar|gtar|detect}
       swlist.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=detect #{pax|tar|gtar|detect}



       GNU Privacy Guard, gpg is required for verification of package
       signatures.

BUGS
       swlist is subject to breakage if a user's account on an intermediate
       (or terminal) host in a target spec is not configured to use a Bourne
       compatible shell. (This breakage may be eliminated by use of the --no-
       getconf option as explained above.)

       swlist does not currently implement the -v,-a options.  Listing
       products in a distribution is not supported.  Operating on a
       distribution in directory form is not supported.	 The catalog query
       funtions are implemented in awk and subject to its bugs.

NAME
       swverify -- Verify Software

SYNOPSIS
       Posix:

       swverify	 [-d|-r]  [-F]	[-f file]  [-t targetfile] \
       [-x option=value]  [-X options_file]  [-W option] \
       [software_selections]  [@targets]

       swverify	 # Verify standard input

       swverify selection [@ target] # Verify Installed Software

       swverify -d [@ target]

       swverify -d @-	# dash means standard input

       swverify [--scm|--order-files] -d @.  # . means current directory

       swverify [--scm|--order-files] -d @:package_directory

       Implementation Extension:

       swverify [-Wd] -Wemit-digest-file [portable_archive_file]

       swverify [-Wd] -Wemit-signed-file [portable_archive_file]

       swverify [-Wd] [-Wsha1] -Wemit-digest-file [portable_archive_file]

       swverify [-Wd] -Wget-sig-if=sigfilename [portable_archive_file]


DESCRIPTION
       The swverify utility checks the accuracy of software in distributions
       and installed_software.	If no options are given, a serial distribution
       on stdin is verified.

       Currently, swverify does not read the defaults files.  "/" is the
       default target for installed software.  Stdin is the default target for
       distributions.  The built-in value of "installed_software_catalog" is
       "var/lib/swbis/catalog".


OPTIONS
       -d

	      Specify to operate on a distribution rather than installed
	      software.

       -r

	      Specify that target is an alternate root target. (Not currently
	      used)



       software_selections

	      See other man pages.


       targets

	      See other man pages.  Currently, only one (1) target can be
	      specified.


       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.
	      This option not yet implemented.

       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filename.	 This option not yet implemented.

       Other POSIX options not implemented.


POSIX EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Not yet implemented.


IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSION OPTIONS
       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.

       --checksig | -W checksig

	      This is the default action and is the same as the POSIX syntax
	      "-d @target".  If target file is not a directory then verify
	      archive md5 and sha1 and gpg signature directly from the file.
	      If target file is a directory, attempt to verify the signature
	      using GNU tar and gpg and if successful execute the distributor
	      extension script checksig.  If checksig does not exist then exit
	      with failure.
	      FILE may be "." (current directory) or "-" (standard input).  A
	      serial archive file may be compressed with gzip, bzip2, or Unix
	      compress.


       --order-catalog

	      Use the order of files in catalog/dfiles/files to recreate the
	      signed data when verifying the directory (unpacked tarball) form
	      of the package.


       --cvs

	      Read and process information in the ./catalog (before it is
	      authenticated) to correct the file sytem meta-data in an attempt
	      to verify the GPG signature.  It only affects verification on
	      the directory (unpacked tarball), not tarball verification.  It
	      is required when verifying an exported or working SCM (Source
	      Code Management, such as CVS) directory if the SCM does not
	      preserve and restore file system meta-data.  This option also
	      emliminates the dependency on the order of files in file system
	      directories.


       --scm

	      Currently, same as the --cvs option.


       --no-checkdigest

	      When verifying the directory form, do not run the checkdigest
	      script even if the GPG signed data contains the checkdigest
	      script.


       --signed-file  [FILE]

	      Write the GPG signed portion of the package to stdout without
	      verifying it.  Read archive file FILE or standard input and
	      write the signed file (i.e. gpg's signed stuff) to stdout.  This
	      is the catalog section of the Posix package.  This option is
	      supported for the tarball file and unpacked tarball directory.
	      Use of the --scm option may be required for the unpacked tarball
	      directory form.


       --digest-file  [FILE]

	      Write the payload portion of the package to stdout without
	      verifying its digest matches the digest in the signed data.
	      This is the storage section of the Posix package.	 This option
	      is not supported for the unpacked tarball form.


       -W emit-signed-file | -W C

	      Same as --signed-data.  Also the same as -WC


       -W emit-digest-file [FILE]

	      Same as --digest-data.  Also the same as -WS


       -W show-auth-files | -W d

	      Writes the relevent security file to stderr.  Applies to emit-
	      digest-file and emit-signed-file modes.


       -W sig-number=N

	      Operates on the Nth signature, 0 is last, 1 is the first.


       -W get-sig-if=outputfile

	      Verifies the archive digests by comparing to the digests in the
	      catalog and if they match write the sigfile to outputfile and
	      the signed data to stdout.


DISTRIBUTOR SCRIPTS
       Not yet implemented.


IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSION DISTRIBUTOR SCRIPTS
   checkdigest &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/checkdigest
       This script was named 'checksig'.  As of 2006-03-28, the name of this
       script should be 'checkdigest'.	The name 'checksig' should be
       considered deprecated for new packages.

       A software distributor may choose to provide a checkdigest script.  The
       checkdigest  script is part of the distribution object.	It is used to
       verify the directory form of a distribution  (as distinguished from
       installed_software).  The verified attributes are the same as those
       verified from the archive file form with the addition of the
       distribution file list.	In addition the script may chose to verify the
       adjunct_md5sum and file.md5 digests and symbolic links.	Due to the
       constraints of reproducing the archive message digests from the
       directory, which include tar utility dependence and file owner/group
       specification, this script may not be useful to all distributors.

   Execution Environment
	The script may require the SW_CONTROL_TAG environment variable be set
       to "checkdigest" or "checkfile" and if not exit with failure.  swverify
       will set this variable to "checkfile" if the --scm or --cvs option is
       used, and otherwise to "checkdigest".  The script may take different
       action based on the value.  Currently, the checkdigest script used by
       the swbis source package will omit the archive digests checks if set to
       SW_CONTROL_TAG="checkfile" since reproducing the archive digest is not
       possible when the package is exported from CVS due to file system meta-
       data non-preservation. In this case the file list is checked and the
       md5 and sha1 digests are verified for each regular file.

VERIFYING SIGNATURES
       The design separates the payload and catalog, therefore, verification
       requires verifying the storage section md5 and sha1 message digests and
       then verifying the signature of the catalog.  Naturally, it is required
       that the signed data include the storage section message digests and
       that they match the storage sections.  The storage section digests are
       stored as separate attribute files in the dfiles catalog directory.

       The checksig (i.e. swverify -d @-) mode verifies a tarballs embedded
       signature.  This mode checks all the security files in the package and
       is the preferred way to authenticate a package.	The emit-signed-file,
       emit-digest-file modes are useful for testing, sanity checks and custom
       applications.  The get-sig-if is the function used when verifying a
       tarball.

   Verifying a POSIX Distribution Archive Manually
       The design of the authentication attributes supports manual
       verification of the archive file (e.g. tarball) form of the
       distribution, that is verification take place on the uncompressed
       archive using 'gpg', GNU 'tar' and the swbis utility 'swverify' (or the
       library utility 'arf2arf').

       The authentication requires the following steps:

       1) Obtain the signature from the package.
       2) Recreate the signed data and present this byte stream and
	  the signature to GNU privacy guard (gpg) for authentication.
       3) Obtain the message digest (md5, sha1,) contained in the
	  control file in the authenticated archive byte stream.
       4) Recreate the digest byte stream and present to the appropriate
	  hash generation program to generate the message digest.
       5) Compare the digest message generated in step 4 to the
	  authenicated digest obtained in step 3.

	1) Obtain the signature from the package.

	 #!/bin/sh
	 tar zxf - -O \*/catalog/dfiles/signature &lt; swbis-0.460.tar.gz


       2)  Recreate the signed data

	 #!/bin/sh
	 swverify -WC &lt; swbis-0.460.tar.gz | gpg --verify /dev/tty -
	 # Cut and paste the signature file obtained in step 1


       3)  Obtain the message digest

	 #!/bin/sh
	 swverify -WC &lt; swbis-0.460.tar.gz | \
	 tar xf - -O \*/catalog/dfiles/md5sum


       4)  Create the digested byte stream

	 #!/bin/sh
	 swverify -WS &lt; swbis-0.460.tar.gz | md5sum


   Verifying a POSIX Distribution Directory Manually
       Verifying the unpacked tarball package form.

       The design of the authentication attributes supports manual
       verification of the directory (unpacked) form of the distribution, that
       is verification takes place on the leading package directory and its
       contents. It should be noted that it is left to the user to verify that
       the archive installed no files outside of this directory as this would
       likely indicate a trojan'ed package.

       If authenticating on a GNU/Linux system using GNU tar it is possible to
       validate the archive message digests and signature if the following are
       true:


       1) The package file is a tar archive.
       2) The installed version of GNU tar produces archives with
	  bit-for-bit sameness relative to the swpackage(8) utility
	  that generated the signature and message digests.  For packages
	  made with swbis versions >= 0.474 and with format option "ustar"
	  you will need GNU tar 1.14 or 1.15.*
       3) The package has a single leading package directory, like a source
	  package.
       4) The package catalog contains the 'checkdigest' script.
       5) The package catalog contains the distribution file list.
       6) The ownership names are present and have the same uid's and gid's.
       7) The package was unpacked with a version of tar that
	  preserves all file times.  Use for example "tar xpf".


       In this example, the package has a single path name prefix called,
       namedir and the file owner/group are root.  These restrictions are
       suited to source packages.
	Verify the signature:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \
	 namedir/catalog | gpg --verify namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature -

       If this fails try using GNU tar option --posix.	If this fails then,
       try experimenting with the owner, group, and numeric-id options.	 If
       you are unable to verify a tar byte stream using gpg(1) that contains
       the storage section message digests, then the package cannot be
       authenticated.


       Assuming you successfully verified the catalog as shown above, now
       generate the message digest and compare it to the md5sum file attribute
       from the same byte stream that gpg(1) claims is authenticate.

	 #!/bin/sh
	 grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum

	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \
	 namedir/catalog | tar xf - -O	namedir/catalog/dfiles/md5sum

       Likewise for the sha1 digest.

       If the package has symbolic links, Verify the adjunct_md5sum:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
	 ( while read file; do if [ ! -h $file ]; then echo $file; fi done; )|\
	 tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
	 --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum
	 cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/adjunct_md5sum

       The symbolic link files must be verified manually by comparing to the
       INFO file information.

   Verifying a POSIX distribution in tar format
       Below is output from successful authentication.	The authentication
       requires checking the archive md5 message digest (and sha1 if present).
       All present message digests must succeed and if this is true then the
       signed file is written and gpg proceeds to check the signature.	If the
       sig_header file is present then the requirement that its data be
       identical to the ustar header of every signature file is enforced.  If
       any one of these checks fails, authentication fails.

	  #!/bin/sh
	  swverify --checksig mypackage-00.1.tar.gz
	       # - or -
	  swverify -d @- &lt; mypackage-00.1.tar.gz

   Verifying the Directory Form of a Distribution
       Authenticating using 'swverify' is subject to the same constraints as
       verifying manually using GNU tools because swverify implements this
       using GNU tools.

       'swverify' when verifying the directory form of a distribution attempts
       to authenticate the exported catalog signature.	If it is successful it
       executes the 'checkdigest' script found in the 'catalog/dfiles'
       directory of the exported catalog.  If the 'checkdigest' script does
       not exist, authentication fails. 'swverify' will only attempt to run
       the 'checkdigest' script if it is found in the dfiles directory of an
       authenticated catalog.

       'swverify' currently has no provision to verify the archive section
       (i.e. the file storage structure) of a directory (unpacked) form of a
       POSIX distribution.  It is the role of the checkdigest script to do
       this.

       For example, if filemypackage-00.1 is a directory unpacked with a tar
       reading utility that preserved file times then try,


	  #!/bin/sh
	  swverify --checksig mypackage-00.1

	or change directory into mypackage-00.1 and use the POSIX syntax:

	  swverify -d @.



	  swverify -d @`pwd`/mypackage-00.1

	Below is example output of a package with a 'checksig' script.

   Verifying Installed Software
       (This capability is only partially implemented.)	 Verifying Installed
       Software involves comparing the package meta-data to the live file
       system.	The validity of a successful comparison depends on the
       validity of the installed software catalog.  swverify makes no attempt
       to check the validity of the entire catalog, however, it can use the
       distribution GPG signature, which is stored in the catalog, to
       authenticate the meta-data of the selected package.

       Below is an example. Note, the package is selected on the basis of its
       product or bundle tag.

       $ swverify -r your_product_tag @ /

   Create the digest byte stream -Wemit-digest-file mode:
       Here are some examples that verify the archive digests.


	  #!/bin/sh
	  cat your-tarball | swverify -Wd -WS | md5sum


       Your should see a pair of identical digests. Use the -Wsha1 option to
       check the sha1 digest in a similar manner.

       ** IMPORTANT **
       This does not mean that the data is authenticate in the sense of being
       attributable to a person, merely that the md5sum attribute and the
       payload byte stream match.

       To inspect the digested data, try:

	 #!/bin/sh
	 cat your-tarball | swverify -WS | tar tvf -


   Create the signed byte stream -Wemit-signed-file mode:
       Here is an example which allows inspection of the signed file.


	 cat your-tarball | swverify -WC | tar tvf -


   -Wget-sig-if mode:
       This is the mode that is used internally when verifying a tarball.
       Below is an example of using this mode manually.


	 #!/bin/sh
	 cat your-tarball | swverify -Wget-sig-if=/dev/tty | \
	 gpg --verify  /dev/tty -


       Now try to copy and paste the sigfile and gpg should attempt to verify
       the signature.

	      Note:  This verifies the md5 or sha1 digests before writing the
	      signed data to stdout.  If the sha1 or md5 match fails then an
	      empty file is written to stdout.

EXAMPLES
       Examples of verifying distributions and installed software.

   Distribution Verification
       * Verify a tar archive

	 swverify -d &lt; foo-1.1.tar.gz
		  or
	 swverify -d @`pwd`/foo-1.1.tar.gz
		  or
	 swverify -d @:foo-1.1.tar.gz
		  or
	 cat foo-1.1.tar.gz | swverify -d @-

		 Note: --checksig and '-d' perform the same operations.


       * Verify a unpacked distribution

	 swverify -d @`pwd`/foo-1.1
		  or
	 cd foo-1.1; swverify -d @.
		  or
	 swverify -d @:foo-1.1

		 Note: --checksig and '-d' perform the same operations.


       * Verify an exported SCM Directory

	 # This is the same as directory verification except the '--cvs' option is needed.


   Installed Software Verification
       * Verify installed software

	 swverify foo.foo @/tmp/test
		  or
	 swverify foo.foo  # at default target


RETURN VALUE
       Exit status of the checksig script or gpg utility for --checksig
       directory operation.  0 if successful on all targets, 1 if failed on
       all targets, 2 if failed on some targets.

BUGS
       The signature file's archive header (or data) is not part of the signed
       data therefore it may be subject to undetectable tampering, however,
       swverify does perform sanity checks on the pathname, permissions and
       filetype if the sig_header file (See sw(5) manual page.) is not present
       [due to being signed by a old swpackage version], and if sig_header is
       present, swverify requires that it match the sig file header.  The
       ability to verify the unpacked directory form of the package depends on
       many factors not immediately obvious, among them are the tar header
       uname and gname, and whether they are preserved by the reading utility,
       and whether these names are in the system database files /etc/passwd
       and /etc/group, and if so, whether they assign the same uid/gid as the
       package.

       Verification of the directory form of a distribution (i.e. the
       installed tarball path name prefix) such as running 'swverify -d @.'
       after running 'swign @.' will fail if the order of directory entries is
       not compatible with traditional Unix file system directory entry
       ordering, which is the order of file creation.  This ordering is almost
       always apparent on Ext2 file system for small directories (but not
       always for big directories).  Ext3, reiserFS, and DarwinOS et.al file
       systems do not have this ordering, use of the '--order-catalog' option
       is therefore required.  Use of the '--cvs' or '--order-catalog' options
       is theoretically problematic because it causes the use and
       interpretation of data in the verification of that same data therefore
       opening possible attack vectors.

NAME
       swconfig -- Configure installed software

SYNOPSIS
       swconfig	 [-p] [-u]  [-c catalog] [-f file] [-t targetfile] \
       [-x option=value]  [-X options_file]  [-W option] \
       [software_selections]  [@targets]


DESCRIPTION
       swconfig configures, unconfigures, and reconfigures installed software
       on a host.  swconfig is a distributed utility.  Neither swconfig nor
       any component of swbis is required on the target host, however, the
       target host must look like a Unix system at the shell and command-line
       utility level.  Remote network connections are made by ssh.  Ssh is the
       default but rsh can be selected by a command line option.

       swconfig operates on installed software and performs configuration
       primarily by executing the configure or unconfigure control scirpts.
       If these scripts do not exists for an installed package, then swconfig
       takes no action.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE

	      Read the list of software selections from FILE.


       -p

	      Preview mode, establish contact with target host, however,
	      modify nothing.


       -u

	      Undo, run the unconfigure script.


       -c catalog

	      Specify a file of PSF or INDEX syntax or a directory containing
	      the exported catalog.

		     Note:  This option is not yet implemented.


       -t targetfile

	      Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).


       -v

	      Increment the verbose level.


       -x option=value

	      Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.


       -X FILE

	      Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
	      default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
	      the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
	      any options file is disabled.

       --help

	      Show help (Implementation extension)

       -W option[,option,...]

	      Specify the implementation extension option.
	      Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
	      Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
	      extension options may also be given individually using the
	      '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.


       --postinstall

	      run the postinstall or unpostinstall script


       --force-locks

	      override locking and delete existing lock


       --send-environment

	      Include existing environment variables in the remote host's
	      execution environment.  System and common varaiables are
	      excluded and checks are made for tainted values.


       --allow-ambig

	      Allows swconfig to act on all matching entries.  Without this
	      option a software selection that matches more than one installed
	      software entry is an error.


       --sig-level=N

	      Specify number of required GPG signatures, N equal to 0 means
	      don't require the catalog to be signed.

	      to NAME.	This is useful for debugging.

       software_selections

	      Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) using
	      software spec syntax. (See sw(5) for syntax).


       target

	      Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
	      are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
	      where the software collection is located.	 A target that
	      contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
	      interpretation as a path, use a absolute path or prefix with
	      ':'.


       Source and Target Specification and Logic

	    Synopsis:
		 Posix:
		      host[:path]
		      host
		      host:
		      /path  # Absolute path

		 Swbis Extension:
		      [user@]host[:path]
		      [user@]host_port[:path]
		      :path

		 Swbis Multi-hop Target Extension:
		      # ':' is the target delimiter
		   # '_' delimits a port number in the host field

		      [user@]host[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]
		      [user@]host_port[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]

		      # Using ':', a trailing colon is used to
		      # disambiguate between a host and file.
		   # For Example,
		      :file
		      host:
		      host
		      host:file
		      host:host:
		      host_port:host_port:
		      host:host:file
		      user@host:user@host:
		      user@host:user@host:host:
		      user@host:user@host:file

	    A more formal description:

	    target : HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':'
		   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		   | ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING   # Impl extension
		   ;

	      PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING must be an absolute path unless
			      a HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is given.	 Allowing
			      a relative path is a feature of the swbis
			      implementation.

		       NOTE: A '.' as a target is an implementation
			     extension and means extract in current
			     directory.

		       NOTE: A '-' indicating stdout/stdin is an
			     implementation extension.

		       NOTE: A ':' in the first character indicates a filename.
			     This is an implementation extension.

	      HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is an IP or hostname.

	   Examples:
	      Copy the	distribution /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz at 192.168.1.10
		     swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz @192.168.1.10:/root


       Implementation Extension Syntax (multi ssh-hop) :
	   Syntax:
	   %start   wtarget    # the Implementation Extension Target
			       # Note: a trailing ':' forces interpretation
			       # as a host, not a file.
	   wtarget   : wtarget DELIM sshtarget
		     | sshtarget
		     | sshtarget DELIM
		     ;
	   sshtarget : user '@' target # Note: only the last target
		     | target	       # may have a PATHNAME, and only a host
		     ;		       * may have a user
	   target   : HOST_CHARACTER_STRING
		    | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
		    ;
	   user	    : PORTABLE_CHARACTER_STRING	 # The user name

	   DELIM    : ':'   # The multi-hop delimiter.
		    ;




USAGE EXAMPLES
   Run the configure script for package foo on 192.168.1.2:/
	 swconfig foo @ root@192.168.1.2:/



   Show the options
	 swconfig --show-options



EXTENDED OPTIONS
       Extended options can be specified on the command line using the -x
       option or from the defaults file, swdefaults.  Shown below is an actual
       portion of a defaults file which show default values.

   POSIX
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swdefaults or the
       ~/.swdefaults on the local (management host, host where swconfig is
       invoked).  These files on the target host are not used.


	 allow_incompatible	       = false # Not implemented
	 allow_multiple_versions       = false # Not implemented
	 ask			       = false # Not implemented
	 autoselect_dependencies       = true # Not implemented
	 autoselect_dependents	       = true # Not implemented
	 enforce_dependencies	       = true # Not implemented
	 installed_software_catalog    = var/lib/swbis/catalog/
	 logfile		       = /var/log/sw.log
	 loglevel		       = 1
	 select_local		       = true # Not implemented
	 reconfigure		       = false
	 verbose		       = 1


   Swbis Implementation
       These options are set in the /usr/lib/swbis/swbisdefaults or the
       ~/.swbis/swbisdefaults file.


	  swconfig.swbis_no_getconf = true # true or false
	 swconfig.swbis_shell_command = posix # {sh|bash|posix|ksh}
	 swconfig.swbis_no_remote_kill = false # true or false
	 swconfig.swbis_local_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swconfig.swbis_remote_pax_write_command=tar #{pax|tar|star|gtar}
	 swconfig.swbis_local_pax_read_command=tar #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swconfig.swbis_remote_pax_read_command=tar #{pax|tar|gtar|star}
	 swconfig.swbis_local_pax_remove_command=tar
	 swconfig.swbis_remote_pax_remove_command=tar
	 swconfig.swbis_remote_shell_client=ssh
	 swconfig.swbis_forward_agent=True
	 swconfig.swbis_sig_level=0
	 swconfig.swbis_enforce_all_signatures=false


RETURN VALUE
       0 if all targets succeeded, 1 if all targets failed or internal error,
       2 if some targets failed and some succeeded.

NOTES
	Multiple ssh-hops is an implementation extension.

REQUISITE UTILITIES
       The swbis distributed utilities require bash, public domain ksh, or
       Sun's /usr/xpg4/bin/sh to be present on the target host.	 If the
       swbis_shell_command extended option is set to 'detect' you don't have
       to know which one is present, otherwise you may specify one explicitly.

       A POSIX awk is required, and with the ability to specify several
       thousand bytes of program text as a command argument.  GNU awk  works,
       as does the ATT Awk book awk, and the awk on BSD systems.  See the
       INSTALL file for further details regarding a small issue with the
       OpenSolaris (c.2006) awk.

       GNU Privacy Guard, gpg is required for verification of package
       signatures.

       Other utilities required to be in $PATH on the remote host are: dd, pax
       (or tar|star|gtar), mkdir, echo, test, sleep, read (if not builtin).

NAME
       swign -- Create a tar archive of a directory with an embedded GPG
       signature.

SYNOPSIS
       swign [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @- # Write to stdout

       swign [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @.	 # Sign directory

       swign -S [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir]

       swign -E [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir]

DESCRIPTION
       swign reads a PSF (Product Specfication File) to generate and load the
       package catalog into the current directory and then writes the
       cooresponding archive to stdout.	 The PSF is read from standard input
       by default.  To use an internally generated PSF with name and revision
       attributes determined from the name of the current directory use '-s.'.

       The PSF is scanned for replacement tokens for tag and revision
       attributes determined from the current directoy name.  It is expected
       that the current directory name have the form: 'tag-revision'.  The
       replacement string has the form '%__NAME' where NAME is 'tag' or
       'revision'.  The directory derived values can be overridden with the
       '--revision' or '--name-version' options.

       swign by default will remove and re-create the ./catalog/ meta-data
       directory, then use GNU tar to write the current directory as a tar
       archive to stdout.  The result is a tar archive written entirely with
       GNU tar that contains an embedded GPG signature in the control file
       './catalog/dfiles/signature'.  The contents of './catalog/' are
       consistent with the POSIX packaging standard ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999.  The
       package layout of the resulting archive is unchanged except for the
       addition of the './catalog' directory.

       The contents of the archive is the contents of the current directory
       ".".  The pathnames in the archive are prefixed by the base name of
       ".".  The owner and group of all the files in the emitted archive are
       specified by the PSF file and command line options.

       In order for the signature to be valid, the file ownerships specified
       in the PSF must be consistent with the 'swign' command.	swign will
       read the PSF to determine these ownerships automatically from the
       'file_permissions' directive unless the '-o' or '-g' command line
       options are used or if this feature is disabled using the '--no-psf-
       detect' option is given.

       The default ownerships for all the files are the current user's owner
       and group.  If the -o (or -g) option is used with a empty string for
       the option arg then the file ownerships of the source files are used.
       This script assumes GNU tar is installed.

       After writing the ./catalog/ file and before writing the archive, the
       file list stored in ./catalog/dfiles/files is compared to the current
       directory contents, if any difference is found the archive is not
       written and error returned.


OPTIONS
       --help
	      show help.


       --show-psf
	      show the PSF to stdout, and then exit.


       --no-psf-detect
	      Disable automatic detection of the PSF's file ownerships policy.


       --no-remove
	      Don't remove the ./catalog directory before overwriting.


       --file-ownerships
	      Use the file ownerships and permissions of the source files.



       -u, --local-user name
	      Use name as the user ID to sign.


       --homedir=DIR
	      Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If not specified
	      then use "~/.gnupg".


       -s, --source=FILE
	      Specify a PSF file name or one of two special names, '-' for
	      stdin, and '.' for the internally generated PSF.


       -T, --show-names-only
	      show some info (for help and debugging) and exit.


       -t, --run-sanity-check
	      Instead of writing stdout, write the archive to
	      ../packageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz and run some sanity tests.


       -S, --sign-only
	      Write the ./catalog/ file containing the digest and signature
	      into "." and then exit without writing the archive to stdout.
	      Same as using "." as the target such as 'swign @.'


       -E, --emit-only
	      Do not write the ./catalog/ file containing the digest and
	      signature into "." and then write the archive to stdout.	This
	      does not affect the directory contents.


       -D, --with-checkdigest FILE
	      Include the checkdigest control script sourced from FILE.	 This
	      is only needed when not supplying a PSF, that is this option
	      modifies an internally generated PSF.


       -o, --owner OWNER
	      Specify owner.  Use an empty string "" to specify the source
	      file owner.


       -g, --group GROUP
	      Specify group.  Use an empty string "" to specify the source
	      file group.


       --name-version=NAME-REV
	      Specify a product tag and revision as dash delimited.


       -r, --revision REV
	      Specify a product revision.  This will override a revision part
	      of the current directory's name.


       -x format
	      Specify the archive format.  Must be one of the formats of
	      swpackage.


       @-
	      Target, only supported target is standard output.


EXTERNAL EFFECTS
       The program will remove and replace a file in "." named ./catalog/.
       Nothing outside of './catalog/' is modified.
       Standard output is the target for the tar archive.
       When using the '-t' option an archive file is written to
       ../packageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz

       A copy of the PSF is made in /var/tmp/swign$$.  It is normally created
       and erased by the program.


EXAMPLES
       Show the internally generated PSF to stdout.  Change directory into the
       directory to package, then type

	  swign -s. --show-psf
	  #
	  # or specify a owner and group policy
	  swign -s. -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf




       Create a signed metadata (i.e. catalog/) directory of a live directory,
       for example /bin

	      swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u "YourGPGNAME" -o "" -g "" @.




       Generate the package (and verify it) using a PSF that you supply on
       standard input.	Change directory into the directory to package, then
       type

	  swign -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf | swign -s - -u "gpgName" @- | swverify -d @-




       Example of directory signing and authentication.

	  swign -u YourGPGName -s. --file-ownerships -D /HOME/checkdigest.sh --sign-only
	  swverify -d @.
	  swign	 --file-ownerships -emit-only | swverify -d @-




TESTING
       After running successfully with options -S  and -D FILE	the following
       should be true (report no error).

		 swverify --checksig .	 # Deprecated form
		     -or-
		 swverify -d @.	    # POSIX syntax




       Similarly,

		 swign -u "your GPG Name" @- | swverify --checksig -
		     -or-
		 swign -u "your GPG Name" @- | swverify -d @-


       If a checkdigest script is included then you should unpack the package
       at a new location and run  swverify -d @. in the new location.  The
       checkdigest script is a vendor extension control file that is part of
       the GPG signed ./catalog directory.  As an implementation extension
       behavior the swverify program will execute this script after
       verification of the signature.  The script may take any action at this
       point, but the intention is that it be used to verify the contents of
       the package directory using GNU tools such as md5sum, sha1sum, and tar.

       If a checkdigest script is not included, then the package user will
       have to manually execute the commands that would have been executed by
       the script using the file meta-data in an authenticated INFO file.
       When verifying the unpacked directory form of a package,	 the swverify
       program will return an error if the checkdigest script is not present,
       though, it is not required for verification of the tar archive file
       itself using swverify.

       Swign can be used to sign any directory using the file ownerships of
       the source files.  The following commands act as a test of swpackage's
       ability to generate an archive identical to GNU tar.  (Note: the script
       checkdigest.sh is found in ./bin of the source distribution.)

	      swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u "Test User" -o "" -g "" -S;
	      swverify -d @.



PSF ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT
       A PSF that is provided using the '-s' option will be scanned for a
       special character sequence '%__NAME'  where NAME is either 'tag' or
       'revision'.  'tag' is replaced with the package name portion of the
       currrent directory.  'revision' is replaced with the version portion.

BUGS
       Symbolic links in a package are problematic for verifying the unpacked
       form of a package since the modification time is not preserved.	They
       have no affect on verification of the tar archive file using
       'swverify'.

       If a directory is signed using the '-S' option and has a file path
       greater than 99 chars in length then it will be unverifiable if the
       'ustar0' format and GNU tar 1.13.25 was used.

       Verification of the directory form of a distribution (i.e. the
       installed tarball path name prefix) such as running 'swverify -d @.'
       after running 'swign -S' will fail if the order of directory entries is
       not compatible with traditional Unix file system directory entry
       ordering.  This incompatibility may be present in the Ext3, reiserFS,
       and DarwinOS et.al file systems.

       The file ownership policy of the PSF, the checkdigest script (if any)
       and the command line options must agree.	 The default file ownership
       policies of this program are suited to packaged products where file
       user and group ownerships are not a critical feature.

NAME
       lxpsf - Translate packages to a tar archive with a PSF.

SYNOPSIS
       lxpsf [options] [package_file]

DESCRIPTION
       Lxpsf  reads the input package and writes a tar or cpio archive to std-
       out, depending on the native (or	 encapsulated)	format	of  the	 input
       package.	  The  output  layout  has  a  single  leading directory named
       according to the name, version, and release attributes.

       The first regular file is ``PSF'', and is a IEEE	 1387.2-1995  (ISO/IEC
       15068-2:1999)  Product  Specification File containing the package meta-
       data.  Subsequent files are control data represented as files, and, the
       files  of  the  distribution.   The output is designed so the swpackage
       utility is able to form a Posix package from the installed output.

       Currently,  RPM format v3 (both source and binary), Debian Package for-
       mat,  Slackware	runtime	 packages  and	plain vanilla tarballs (with a
       leading directory path) are supported for translation.


   Options
       -p ,--psf-only
	      Write only the psf file to stdout.

       -A ,--psf-form1
	      A PSF form for RPM translation (deprecated).

       -A ,--psf-form2
	      A second PSF form for RPM translation (deprecated).

       -A ,--psf-form3
	      A third PSF form for RPM translation (current).


       -H format
	      Force the specified format.  The	choices	 are  currently
	      (only) ustar.

       -x ,--use-recursive-fileset
	      Use  "file  *"  instead of individual file definitions in
	      the PSF.

       -r ,--no-leading-path
	      use "." as the leading archive path.

       -o ,--info-only
	      Write the INFO file for the rpm archive to stdout.

       -D ,debug-level=TYPE
	      Always set to "link"

HOWTO Use with swpackage
       Either install into file system or use the -W source=- option of
       GNU swpackage.

	 cat your_rpm.rpm |
	 lxpsf --format=ustar --psf-form3 |
	 (mkdir /tmp/swbis; cd /tmp/swbis &amp;&amp; tar xpf -; exit $?) &amp;&amp;
	 (cd /tmp/swbis &amp;&amp; swpackage -s PSF @- ) | tar tvf -

	 cat your_rpm.rpm |
	 lxpsf --format=ustar --psf-form3 |
	 swpackage -W source=- -s@PSF @- | tar tvf -

NAME
       swpackage -- file formats

SYNOPSIS
       Output format - Data Interchange Formats
       Input format - Product Specification File (PSF)

SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT
       The output format is either one of two formats specified in POSIX.1
       (ISO/IEC 9945-1) which are tar (header magic=ustar) or cpio (header
       magic=070707).  The default format of the swbis implementation is
       "ustar".	 The POSIX spec under specifies definitions for some of the
       ustar header fields.  The personality of the default swbis ustar format
       mimics GNU tar 1.15.1 and is designed to be compliant to POSIX.1.  The
       personality of the "ustar0" format mimics, for pathnames less than 99
       octets,	GNU tar 1.13.25 using the "-b1 --posix" options.  This bit-
       for-bit sameness does not exist for pathnames greater than 99 chars as
       swbis follows the POSIX spec and GNU tar 1.13.25 does not.  The
       "ustar0" ustar personality is deprecated.  It is only slightly
       different from 'ustar' in how device number fields are filled (with
       spaces, zeros or NULs) for non-device files.

       In addition the swbis implementation supports several other tar
       variants including bit-for-bit mimicry of GNU tar (1.13.25) default
       format which uses a non-standard name split and file type (type 'L').
       This format is known as '--format=oldgnu'.  Also supported is the gnu
       format of GNU tar 1.15.1 specified by '--format=gnu'

       The defacto cpio formats are also supported.  "new ASCII" (sometimes
       called SVR4 cpio) and "crc" cpio formats with header magic "070701" and
       "070702" respectively.

       Support for "pax Interchange Format" (Extended header tar) described in
       IEEE 1003.1-2001 under the "pax" manual page is planned.

       The entirety of the output byte stream is a single valid file of one
       the formats mentioned above.

       The swbis implementation writes its output to stdout.  The default
       output block size is 10240 bytes.  The last block is not padded and
       therefore the last write(2) may be a short write.  The selected block
       size does not affect the output file contents.

       The swbis implementation is biased, in terms of capability and default
       settings, to the tar format.  Package signing is only supported in tar
       format.

SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT
       The input file is called a product specification file or PSF.  It
       contains information to direct swpackage and information that is
       package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged into the global
       INDEX file].

       A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs) and
       Extended Definitions (described below).	An object keyword connotes a
       logical object (i.e. software structure) supported by the standard.  An
       object keyword does not have a value field after it, as it contains
       Attributes and Extended Definitions.  An attribute keyword conotes an
       attribute which is always in the form of a keyword/value pair.

       Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and are
       transferred into the INDEX file.	 Object keywords not recognized by the
       standard are not allowed and will generate an error.  Extended
       Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created
       by swpackage).  Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into
       object keywords (objects) and attributes recognized by the standard.

       Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the swbis
       implementation of swpackage.

       The file syntax is the same as a INDEX, or INFO file.  A PSF may
       contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended
       definitions.

       For additional information see
       XDSA C701 http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm, or
       sw manual page.

   EXTENDED DEFINITIONS
       A Product Specification File (PSF) can contain Extended Definitions in
       the fileset, product or bundle software definitions.  They would have
       the same level or containment relationship as a file or control_file
       definition in the same contaning object.

       Extended Definitions represent a minimal, expressive form for
       specifying files and file attributes.  Their use in a PSF is optional
       in that an equivalent PSF can be constructed without using them,
       however, their use is encouraged for the sake of brevity and
       orthogonality.

       The swbis implementation requires that no [ordinary] attributes appear
       after Extended Definitions in the containing object, and, requires that
       Extended Definitions appear before logically contained objects.	That
       is, the parser uses the next object keyword to syntacticly and
       logically terminate the current object even if the current object has
       logically contained objects.

   o  Extended Control File Definitions
	    checkinstall  source  [path]
	    preinstall	  source  [path]
	    postinstall	  source  [path]
	    verify	  source  [path]
	    fix		  source  [path]
	    checkremove	  source  [path]
	    preremove	  source  [path]
	    postremove	  source  [path]
	    configure	  source  [path]
	    unconfigure	  source  [path]
	    request	  source  [path]
	    unpreinstall  source  [path]
	    unpostinstall source  [path]
	    space	  source  [path]
	    control_file  source  [path]


       The source attribute defines the location in distributors's development
       system where the swpackage utility will find the script.	 The keyword
       is the value of the tag attribute and tells the utilities when to
       execute the script.  The path attribute is optional and specifies the
       file name in the packages distribution relative to the
       control_directory for software containing the script. If not given the
       tag value is used as the filename.

   o  Directory Mapping
	  directory  source  [destination]


       Applies the source attribute as the directory under which the
       subsequently listed files are located.  If destination is defined it
       will be used as a prefix to the path (implied) file definition.	source
       is typically a temporary or build location and dest is its unrealized
       absolute pathname destination.

   o  Recursive File Definition
	 file *


       Specifies every file in current source directory.  The directory
       extended definition must be used before the recursive specification.

   o  Explicit File Definition
	 file [-t type] [-m mode] [-o owner[,uid]] [-g group[,gid]] [-n] [-v] source [path]


       source


	      source defines the pathname of the file to be used as the source
	      of file data and/or attributes.  If it is a relative path, then
	      swpackage searches for this file relative to the the source
	      argument of the directory keyword, if set.  If directory keyword
	      is not set then the search is relative to the current working
	      directory of the swpackage utility's invocation.

	      All attributes for the destination file are taken from the
	      source file, unless a file_permissions keyword is active, or the
	      -m, -o, or -g options are also included in the file
	      specification.

       path

	      path defines the destination path where the file will be created
	      or installed.  If it is a relative path, then the destination
	      path of the of the directory keyword must be active and will be
	      used as the path prefix.	If path is not specified then source
	      is used as the value of path and directory mapping applied (if
	      active).

       -t type

	      type may one of 'd' (directory), or  'h' (hard link), or 's'
	      (symbolic link).

	      -t d  Create a directory.
	      If path is not specified source is used as the path attribute.

	      -t h  Create a hard link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

	      -t s  Create a symbolic link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

       -m mode

	      mode defines the octal mode for the file.

   o  Default Permission Definition
	 file_permissions [-m mode] [-u umask] [-o [owner[,]][uid]] [-g [group[,]][gid]]


       Applies to subsequently listed file definitions in a fileset.  These
       attributes will apply where the file attributes were not specified
       explicitly in a file definition.	 Subsequent file_permissions
       definitions simply replace previous definitions (resetting all the
       options).

       To reset the file_permission state (i.e. turn it off) use one of the
       following:
	   file_permissions ""
	    or the preferred way is
	   file_permissions -u 000

   o  Excluding Files
	  exclude source


       Excludes a previously included file or an entire directory.

   o  Including Files
	  include &lt;filename


       The contents of filename may be more definitions for files.  The syntax
       of the included file is PSF syntax.


   SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS
       This section describes attribute usage and conventions imposed by the
       swbis implementation.  Not all attributes are listed here.  Those that
       are have important effects or particular interest.

   o Distribution Attributes
       The standard defines a limited set of attributes for the distribution
       object.	An expanded set is suggested by the informative annex however
       a conforming implementation is not required act on them.	 The reason
       for this is a distribution may be acted upon by a conforming utility in
       such a way that attributes of the distribution become invalid.  For
       this reason, some attributes that refer to an entire "package" [in
       other package managers] are referred from the product object and attain
       their broadened scope by the distributor's convention that their
       distribution contains just one product.

       For example, the package NAME and VERSION are referred from the product
       tag and revision, not the distribution's.  This convention supports
       multiple products in a distribution and is consistent with the
       standard.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the
	      distribution.  Providing a distribution tag is optional.	The
	      swbis implementation will use this as the [single] path name
	      prefix if there is no distribution.control_directory attribute.
	      A distribution tag attribute and swpackage's response to it is
	      an implementation extension.  The leading package path can also
	      be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.


       control_directory

	      control_directory, in a distribution object, is the constant
	      leading package path.  Providing this attribute is optional.  A
	      distribution control_directory attribute and swpackage's
	      response to it is an implementation extension.  The leading
	      package path can also be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.
	      This attribute will be generated by swpackage if not set in a
	      PSF.


   o Bundle Attributes
       A bundle defines a collection of products whether or not the
       distribution has all the products present.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the bundle.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  If it is not
	      present the product tag is used.


   o Product Attributes
       A product defines the software product.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the product.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  It is required.
	      The swbis implementation uses it in a way that is analogous to
	      the RPMTAG_NAME attribute, namely as the public recognizable
	      name of the package.


       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the distribution under which the
	      product contents are located.  This value has no affect on the
	      installed software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then
	      the tag is used.


       revision

	      Is the product revision.	It should not contain a "RELEASE"
	      attribute part or other version suffix modifiers.	 This value is
	      used by the swbis implementation as a path name component in the
	      installed software catalog.  It is required by swinstall.


       vendor_tag

	      This is a short identifying name of the distributor that
	      supplied the product and may associate (refer to) a vendor
	      object from the INDEX file that has a matching tag attribute.
	      This attribute is optional.  This attribute value should strive
	      to be unique among all distributors. The swbis implementation
	      modifies the intended usage slightly as a string that strives to
	      be globally unique for a given product.tag and product.revision.
	      In this capacity it serves to distinguish products with the same
	      revision and tag from the same or different distributor.	It
	      most closely maps to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or "debian_revision"
	      attributes.  It is one of the version distinguishing attributes
	      of a product specified by the standard.  It is transfered into
	      the installed_software catalog (not as a path name component) by
	      swinstall.  If this attribute exists there should also be a
	      vendor object in the PSF in the distribution object that has
	      this tag.	 This attribute is assigned the value of
	      RPMTAG_RELEASE by swpackage when translating an RPM.


       architecture

	      This string is one of the version attributes.  It is used to
	      disambiguate products that have the same tag, revision and
	      vendor_tag.  It is not used for determining a products
	      compatibility with a host.  The form is implementation defined.
	      swbis uses the output of GNU config.guess as the value of this
	      string.  A wildcard pattern should not be used.  The canonical
	      swbis architecture string can be listed with swlist. For example

	      swlist -a architecture @ localhost

	       Here are some example outputs from real systems.

		  System      `uname -srm`		architecture
	      Red Hat 8.0:  Linux 2.4.18 i686	     i686-pc-linux-gnu
	      OpenSolaris:  SunOS 5.11 i86pc	     i386-pc-solaris2.11
	      NetBSD 3.1:   NetBSD 3.1 i386	     i386-unknown-netbsdelf3.1
	      Red Hat 4.1:  Linux 2.0.36 i586	     i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1
	      Debian 3.1:   Linux 2.6.8-2-386 i686   i686-pc-linux-gnu



       os_name os_release os_version machine_type

	      These attributes are used to determine compatibility with a
	      host.  They correspond to the uname attributes defined by
	      POSIX.1.	If an value is nil or non-existent it is assumed to
	      match the host.  All attributes must match for there to be
	      compatibility.  Distributors may wish to make these values a
	      shell pattern in their PSF's so to match the intended collection
	      of hosts.	 swbis uses fnmatch (with FLAGS=0) to determine a
	      match.


   o Fileset Attributes
       A fileset defines the fileset.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the fileset.  It
	      is required although selection of filesets is  not yet supported
	      therefore the end user will have little to do with the fileset
	      tag.

       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the product under which the fileset
	      contents are located.  This value has no affect on the installed
	      software catalog.	 If it is not given in a PSF then the tag is
	      used.

   o Example Source Package PSF
       This PSF packages every file is current directory. It uses nil control
       directories so the package structure does not change relative to a
       vanilla tarball.

	distribution
	  description "fooit - a program from fooware
       that does everything."
	  title "fooit - a really cool program"
	  COPYING &lt; /usr/local/fooware/legalstuff/COPYING
	vendor
	  the_term_vendor_is_misleading false
	  tag fooware
	  title fooware Consultancy Services, Inc.
	  description ""
	vendor
	  the_term_vendor_is_misleading true
	  tag myfixes1
	  title Bug fixes, Set 1
	  description "a place for more detailed description"
	product
	  tag fooit
	  control_directory ""
	  revision 1.0
	  vendor_tag myfixes1  # Matches the vendor object above
	fileset
	   tag fooit-SOURCE
	   control_directory ""
	   directory .
	   file *
	   exclude catalog



   o Example Runtime (Binary) Package PSF
       This is a sample PSF for a runtime package.  It implies multiple
       products (e.g. sub-packages) using the bundle.contents attribute.
       Since the bundle and product tags exist in a un-regulated namespace and
       are seen by end users they should be carefully chosen.	Note that the
       bundle and product have the same tag which may force downstream users
       to disambiguate using software selection syntax such as fooit,bv=* or
       fooit,pv=* .

	distribution
	  description "fooit - a program from fooware
       that does everything."
	  title "fooit - a really cool program"
	  COPYING &lt; /usr/local/fooware/legalstuff/COPYING

	    vendor
	       the_term_vendor_is_misleading false
	       tag fooware
	       title fooware Consultancy Services, Inc.
	       description "Provider of the programs
	that do everything"

	    vendor
	       the_term_vendor_is_misleading true
		tag fw0
		title fooware fixes
		description "More fixes from the fooware users"

       #  Bundle definition:  Use a bundle
	    bundle
		tag fooit
		vendor_tag fooware
		contents fooit,v=fw0 fooit-devel fooit-doc

       #  Product definition:
	    product
		tag fooit   # This is the package name
		revision 1.0 # This is the package version
		vendor_tag fw0 # This is a release name e.g. RPMTAG_RELEASE

       Example Package

SOFTWARE PACKAGING LAYOUT
       A package may exist in two forms: as a directory in a file system, or a
       serial access tar or cpio archive file.	A package consists of two main
       sections: 1) the exported catalog structure, and, 2) the software file
       storage structure.  Each section may contain path name components which
       serve to segregate distribution, product and fileset objects.

       Shown below is an example with one (1) product and one (1) fileset.

	&lt;path>/
	&lt;path>/catalog/
	&lt;path>/catalog/INDEX
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/...
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;pfiles>/INFO
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;pfiles>/...
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/INFO
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/...
	&lt;path>/catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/&lt;script>
	&lt;path>/&lt;prod_dir>/
	&lt;path>/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/
	&lt;path>/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/&lt;distribution_files>
	&lt;path>/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/&lt;distribution_files>/...


       The exported catalog structure consists of the files with pathnames
       that begin &lt;path>/catalog.  Note that catalog is not a legal prod_dir
       name. Also, "dfiles", and "pfiles" should not be used as control
       directory names, they are the default names for the Distribution and
       Product files directories.  The dfiles and pfiles defaults are commonly
       accepted.

       The order of files in a serial access archive is specified and shown
       above.  The order of products and filesets within a product is not
       specified, although they must be grouped together.  Notably, the INDEX
       file is the first regular file in the package, followed by the &lt;dfiles>
       directory.  For each product, the &lt;prod_dir> is followed immediately by
       the &lt;prod_dir>/&lt;pfiles> directory.

   Minimal Package Layout
       To support extant usage of tar archives, this implementation supports a
       minimal package layout.	The layout is non-intrusive to the current
       practice of extracting a 'binary' package in the '/' directory where
       &lt;path>/ is nil and, likewise to 'source' packages where &lt;path> is
       typically the package name and version.	The use of nil control
       directories is not attested to in the POSIX standard.

	&lt;path>/
	&lt;path>/catalog/
	&lt;path>/catalog/INDEX
	&lt;path>/catalog/dfiles/
	&lt;path>/catalog/dfiles/INFO
	&lt;path>/catalog/dfiles/...
	&lt;path>/catalog/pfiles/INFO
	&lt;path>/catalog/pfiles/...
	&lt;path>/catalog/INFO
	&lt;path>/&lt;distribution_files>/...


       In this layout a single product and fileset have control_directory
       attributes specified as an empty string.

   Distribution Files
       catalog/&lt;dfiles>/...

       &lt;dfiles> is the value of the dfiles attribute and the default value is
       "dfiles".  This directory can store an INDEX file or INFO file
       pertaining to the distribution.	It can also store an attribute of the
       distribution as a separate file where file name is the name of the
       attribute and the file contents the value.

   Product Files
       catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;pfiles>/...

       &lt;pfiles> is the value of the pfiles attribute and the default value is
       "pfiles".  This directory can store an INFO file pertaining to the
       product control_files,  control scripts defined in the INFO file, and
       all other distributor-defined control_files.  It can also store an
       attribute of the product as a separate file.

   Fileset Files
       catalog/&lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/...

       This directory contains information in the same form as does the
       Product Files although pertaining to the fileset.

   Control Directory Names
       The &lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir> names are the values of the
       control_directory attribute for the product and fileset respectively.
       The default value is the value of the tag attribute.  &lt;prod_dir> must
       be unique within a distribution and &lt;fileset_dir> must be unique within
       a product.

   File Storage
       &lt;prod_dir>/&lt;fileset_dir>/&lt;distribution_files>/...

       The listing of control directories in the exported catalog structure is
       repeated and files of the distribution appear under these directories
       in a location determined by the metadata.

       The standard does not require that files that are not regular files
       appear in the storage section.

SOFTWARE DEFINITIONS
       The Software Definitions are metadata representations of the objects
       and attributes recognized by the standard.  The right hand column in
       each definition shows the default attribute value.  The defining
       standard for each attribute is indicated as a comment (leading '#'
       sign) if it is not IEEE-1387.2,	other defining standards are XDSA C701
       (C701), and, this implementation (impl.).

   Host Definition
	host
	  hostname     hostname	      None
	  os_name      os_name	      None
	  os_release   os_release     None
	  os_version   os_version     None
	  machine_type machine_type   None


       The host definition was attested to only in the informative annex of
       the standard.  An implementation may chose to define this class.

       A host object can contain a distribution, or installed_software object.


   Distribution Definition
	distribution
	  layout_version layout_version	 1.0
	  path		 path		 Implementation Defined
	  dfiles	 dfiles		 dfiles
	  pfiles	 pfiles		 pfiles
	  uuid		 uuid		 Empty string


       The path attribute is not in a PSF nor INDEX files.  A PSF does not
       contain a uuid attribute.  An INDEX file will contain a layout_version
       attribute as the first attribute.

       A distribution object can contain bundles, products, and, media in the
       form of software definitions.

       The following attributes are recognized as valuable by the Informative
       Annex of POSIX.7.2.

	  tag		     tag		Empty string
	  title		     title		Empty string
	  description	     description	Empty string
	  revision	     revision		Empty string
	  media_type	     media_type		Empty string
	  copyright	     copyright		Empty string
	  create_time	     create_time	Empty string
	  number	     number		Empty string
	  architecture	     architecture	Empty string


       The following attributes are recognized by this implementation.

	  signature	     &lt; pathname	 None	# impl.
	  sig_header   &lt; pathname  None	  # impl.
	  sha1sum	     &lt; pathname	 None	# impl.
	  sha512sum	      &lt; pathname  None	 # impl.
	  md5sum	     &lt; pathname	 None	# impl.
	  adjunct_md5sum     &lt; pathname	 None	# impl.
	  files		     &lt; pathname	   None	 # impl.
	  control_directory  control_directory	    Empty string   # impl.
	  owner		     name			    root   # impl.
	  group		     name			    root   # impl.
	  mode		     mode			    0755    # impl.
	  signer_pgm	     utility_name		    GPG	   # impl.
	  signer_pgm_version version			    1	 # impl.
	  tar_format_emulation_options program_options		# impl.
	  tar_format_emulation_utility software spec		# impl.


       The url attribute is the universal record locator of the packager
       qualified vendor.  The control_directory attribute in the distribution
       object appears as the &lt;path> leading directory path in the a serial
       archive package.	 The owner, group, and mode attributes control the
       file attributes of the single path name prefix.	The signature,
       sig_header, md5sum, and adjunct_md5sum attributes are described below
       and are stored as separate files in the dfiles directory. The
       tar_format_emulation_* options define the GNU tar version and format
       options that the archive file mimics, these attributes are used by the
       'checkdigest' script.

   Installed_software Definition
	installed_software
	  layout_version layout_version	 1.0
	  path		 path		 Implementation Defined
	  dfiles	 dfiles		 dfiles
	  pfiles	 pfiles		 dfiles
	  catalog	 catalog	 Undefined
	  install_time	 install_time	 Undefined	 # impl.


       A software object can be listed (written to stdout) in the form of an
       INDEX file by the swlist utility.


   Media Definition
	media
	  sequence_number sequence_number  1


       An INDEX file must contain the sequence_number attribute if the
       distribution spans multiple media.


   Vendor Definition
	vendor
	  the_term_vendor_is_misleading	 true		       True or False  #impl
	  tag	      tag	    Empty string
	  title	      title	    Empty string
	  description description   Empty string
	  qualifier   qualifier	    Empty string  # impl.
	  url	      url	    Empty string  # impl.
	  vendor_tag  tag	    Empty string  # impl.


       The tag attribute is required.  The the_term_vendor_is_misleading is
       required in a PSF file to avert a (harmless) warning, please use it.
       It exists to allow persons, for example, who are distributors (of
       existing free software) to qualify themselves away from the
       connotations of a "vendor" which has specific meaning not applicable to
       a free software distributor.  A INDEX and PSF files can contain vendor
       definitions.  The vendor_tag attribute contains the vendor.tag of the
       upstream distributor.  The qualifier attribute value may be one of:
       seller, author, packager, maintainer.  A distribution may have more
       than one vendor definition.  They may form a chain of references from
       the product.vendor_tag to the last vendor referred to by the

       The tag and contents attributes are required in INDEX and PSF files.
       The size attribute is not allowed in either file. The value of size is
       generated dynamically.  An INDEX file will contain a instance_id
       attribute.  Bundle definitions for distributions will not contain
       either the location or qualifier, installed_software objects may
       contain these attributes.

       The tag and control_directory attributes are required.  The size
       attribute is not allowed in either file. The value of size is generated
       dynamically.  An INDEX file will contain a instance_id attribute.  A
       product object can contain control_files, files, and, subproducts in
       the form of software definitions.

       The product.vendor_tag refers to the downstream distributor.  This
       value is be the analogous to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or debian_release
       attributes.  The original upstream author's package, for example, would
       not use this attribute because that package would not have a release
       part in its name, but could (or should) provide a vendor object in the
       PSF.

       The architecture attribute contains an implementation defined name
       describing the architecture.  This attribute may be a pattern.  The
       swbis implementation uses the output of GNU config.guess
       (timestamp=2007-01-15) as the string to be matched by this pattern.

       The tag and control_directory attributes are required.  A PSF should
       not contain the location, media_sequence_number, size, or state
       attributes.  A fileset object can contain control_files, files, in the
       form of software definitions.

       A PSF must contain source attribute.  A source  attribute in an INFO
       will be ignored.	 A PSF should not contain the cksum, compressed_cksum,
       compressed_size, compression_state, compression_type, or size
       attributes.

       Extended Control File Definitions) or an attribute stored as a file.


SOFTWARE SELECTIONS
       The Software Selections provide a means to specify and select (possibly
       with a shell matching pattern) specific Software objects.  A selection
       is made using a software spec.  A software spec may not contain white
       space (a list of multiple selections is white space delimited).	A
       software spec consists of tag values and	 version_ids.  Multiple tags
       are '.' (dot) delimited with the leftmost specifying the broadest (most
       general) software object such as a bundle or product and the rightmost
       being most specific (The swbis implementation does not support fileset
       tags in a software spec). The tags may be followed by nothing, or a
       comma and one or more Version Identifiers which are ',' comma
       delimited.

       Dependency Specs are software specs.

   Version Identifiers
       Version Identifiers specify specific attributes of a software object.
       There are five (5) specified. They are signified by a single letter:
       r,a,v,l,q.  An implementation may support additional ones and may
       support qualification to a specific object type by prefixing a 'p' or
       'b' or 'f' for bundle, product, or fileset respectively.	 The value of
       the attribute follows an equals sign '=', or in the case of a revision
       id, a relational operator.

	Letter	   Attribute
	  r    revision	  r&lt;relop>revsion
				    # A relop may be ==,&lt;,>,&lt;=,>=
	  v    vendor_tag    v=vendor_tag
	  q    qualifier     q=qualifier
	  l    location	     l=location
	  a    architecture  a=arch


       Implementation Extension Version Ids are the following:

	Letter	   Attribute
	  i    catalog_instance_id   i=number

	The catalog instance_id is a directory in the installed software
       catalog that distinguishes installed instances of packages with the
       same name and revision but at different locations.

   Example Software Specs
	   emacs,r==21.2
	   kde.kdegames # This assumes that 'kde' was specified as the bundle
			# in the kdegames package
	   foobar,r>1.0,v=tycoon003
	   somepackage,r>1.0,r&lt;=1.3  # revision is the product revision by default
	   somepackage,pr>1.0,pr&lt;=1.3  # explicitly specify revision is the product revision



DEPENDENCY SPECS
       A dependency spec is a software spec.  There are three types:
       prerequisites, exrequisites, corequisites.  These attributes apply to
       the fileset and are placed in the fileset object in a PSF file.	A
       prerequisites is something that must be installed, and a exrequisites
       is something that must not be installed.	 A corequisites is something
       that must be installed with, corequisites are not supported at this
       time.  prerequisites map to RPMTAG_REQUIRENAME, RPMTAG_REQUIREVERSION,
       and RPMTAG_REQUIREFLAGS attributes.

   Dependency Spec Examples
	  # Alternation	 Require a package named foo1 or foo2
	  prerequisite	 foo1|foo2

	  # Require a package named foo1 and foo2
	  prerequisite	 foo1 foo2

	  # multiple prerequisite keywords can be used
	  prerequisite	foo1
	  prerequisite	foo2

	  # Require a revision range and a certain vendor_tag
	  prerequisite	foo1,r>2,r&lt;3,v=mydist*


EXTENDED DEFINITIONS
       A Product Specification File (PSF) can contain Extended Definitions in
       the fileset, product or bundle software definitions.  They would have
       the same level or containment relationship as a file or control_file
       definition in the same contaning object.

       Extended Definitions represent a minimal, expressive form for
       specifying files and file attributes.  Their use in a PSF is optional
       in that an equivalent PSF can be constructed without using them,
       however, their use is encouraged for the sake of brevity and
       orthogonality.

       The swbis implementation requires that no [ordinary] attributes appear
       after Extended Definitions in the containing object, and, requires that
       Extended Definitions appear before logically contained objects.	That
       is, the parser uses the next object keyword to syntacticly and
       logically terminate the current object even if the current object has
       logically contained objects.

   o  Extended Control File Definitions
	    checkinstall  source  [path]
	    preinstall	  source  [path]
	    postinstall	  source  [path]
	    verify	  source  [path]
	    fix		  source  [path]
	    checkremove	  source  [path]
	    preremove	  source  [path]
	    postremove	  source  [path]
	    configure	  source  [path]
	    unconfigure	  source  [path]
	    request	  source  [path]
	    unpreinstall  source  [path]
	    unpostinstall source  [path]
	    space	  source  [path]
	    control_file  source  [path]


       The source attribute defines the location in distributors's development
       system where the swpackage utility will find the script.	 The keyword
       is the value of the tag attribute and tells the utilities when to
       execute the script.  The path attribute is optional and specifies the
       file name in the packages distribution relative to the
       control_directory for software containing the script. If not given the
       tag value is used as the filename.

   o  Directory Mapping
	  directory  source  [destination]


       Applies the source attribute as the directory under which the
       subsequently listed files are located.  If destination is defined it
       will be used as a prefix to the path (implied) file definition.	source
       is typically a temporary or build location and dest is its unrealized
       absolute pathname destination.

   o  Recursive File Definition
	 file *


       Specifies every file in current source directory.  The directory
       extended definition must be used before the recursive specification.

   o  Explicit File Definition
	 file [-t type] [-m mode] [-o owner[,uid]] [-g group[,gid]] [-n] [-v] source [path]


       source


	      source defines the pathname of the file to be used as the source
	      of file data and/or attributes.  If it is a relative path, then
	      swpackage searches for this file relative to the the source
	      argument of the directory keyword, if set.  If directory keyword
	      is not set then the search is relative to the current working
	      directory of the swpackage utility's invocation.

	      All attributes for the destination file are taken from the
	      source file, unless a file_permissions keyword is active, or the
	      -m, -o, or -g options are also included in the file
	      specification.

       path

	      path defines the destination path where the file will be created
	      or installed.  If it is a relative path, then the destination
	      path of the of the directory keyword must be active and will be
	      used as the path prefix.	If path is not specified then source
	      is used as the value of path and directory mapping applied (if
	      active).

       -t type

	      type may one of 'd' (directory), or  'h' (hard link), or 's'
	      (symbolic link).

	      -t d  Create a directory.
	      If path is not specified source is used as the path attribute.

	      -t h  Create a hard link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

	      -t s  Create a symbolic link.
	      path and source are specified.  source is used as the value of
	      the link_source attribute, and path is the value of the path
	      attribute.

       -m mode

	      mode defines the octal mode for the file.

   o  Default Permission Definition
	 file_permissions [-m mode] [-u umask] [-o [owner[,]][uid]] [-g [group[,]][gid]]


       Applies to subsequently listed file definitions in a fileset.  These
       attributes will apply where the file attributes were not specified
       explicitly in a file definition.	 Subsequent file_permissions
       definitions simply replace previous definitions (resetting all the
       options).

       To reset the file_permission state (i.e. turn it off) use one of the
       following:
	   file_permissions ""
	    or the preferred way is
	   file_permissions -u 000

   o  Excluding Files
	  exclude source


       Excludes a previously included file or an entire directory.

   o  Including Files
	  include &lt;filename


       The contents of filename may be more definitions for files.  The syntax
       of the included file is PSF syntax.

DISTRIBUTOR KEYWORDS
       A software definition file (INFO, INDEX or psf) may contain keywords
       not recognized by the standard.	Such keywords will be parsed as an
       attribute keyword, that is as an attribute of the containing object
       (keyword) software definition.

PACKAGE SECURITY
       The Package Security Attributes are distribution attributes stored as
       separate files.	They are implementation extensions.  They consist of
       archive digests, catalog signature, catalog signature header, and
       individual file md5, sha1, and sha512 digests.


   Archive Digests
       md5sum, sha1sum, and sha512sum are the md5 and sha1 and sha512 digests
       (ascii representations) of the leading package directories that do not
       have the catalog pathname component followed by the software file
       storage structure portion of the uncompressed serial access package
       file including all archive format trailer blocks.

	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/md5sum
	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/sha1sum
	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/sha512sum


   Adjunct Md5 Digest
       adjunct_md5sum is the same as the md5sum excluding symbolic links.  If
       a package does not contain symbolic links the md5sum and adjunct_md5sum
       will be identical.

	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/adjunct_md5sum


       Explanation: This attribute is called 'adjunct' because it is a digest
       of a subset of the files in the package.	 It exists to facilitate
       verifying file integrity of the directory form of a package in an
       environment where the modification time of symbolic link files are not
       preserved from the serial archive by the tar utility or operating
       system.	The ability to verify even the adjunct_md5sum from the
       directory form of the package is dependent on the tar creating utility
       and other attributes of a POSIX.2 environment.

   Catalog Signature Header
       The sig_header file is a ustar header that is identical bit-for-bit to
       the ustar header of the signature file.	It always precedes the
       signature file archive members.

	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/sig_header


       The sig_header protects the tar header of the signature files from
       tampering.  This is required because neither the signature file bytes
       nor the signature tar header are included in the signed data.

   Catalog Signature
       The signature protects the metadata section of the archive.  The
       contents of payload section are only included in the form of a
       crytographic digest.  The sha1 digest is preferred over the md5 digest
       for technical reasons.  If the metadata section does not contain the
       payload section digests then there is no way to verify the payload from
       the signature.


	      &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/signature


       The signed data is the exported catalog structure of the uncompressed
       serial archive package file up to but not including the first byte of
       the software file storage structure followed by two (2) 512 byte null
       blocks if tar format, and no trailer bytes if not tar format.  The
       signature file archive member itself is not included in the signed
       stream, it is intended that the &lt;path>/catalog/&lt;dfiles>/md5sum file is
       included in the signed stream.

       The signature file is ASCII armored.  The last printable character of
       the signature is followed by one or more newline characters (0x0A).
       The total length of the file must match the file size specified in the
       size field of the sig_header file.  The ustar header of every signature
       archive member shall be identical to the sig_header file.  The padded
       size is predetermined [by swpackage] and currently set to be 1024
       octets.	This means the armored sig file has a length limitation of
       1023 octets.

       If multiple signature archive members exist they must follow one
       another in the archive with no other intervening files; and, the same
       sig_header file is the ustar header for all the signature archive
       members.	 A signature archive member, whether alone or one of many, is
       never part of the signed data stream.

   File Digests
	      file.cksum
	      file.md5sum
	      file.sha1sum
	      file.sha512sum

       Each file can have none or all of these digests.

SOFTWARE DEFINITION FILES
       The metadata files, INDEX, INFO and PSF, contain information about the
       software in the form of software definitions.  The INDEX and INFO files
       appear in a package directory structure.	 They are automatically
       generated by the 'swpackage' command.  The location in the directory
       structure indicates the higher level object to which their data
       pertains.  The PSF file does not appear in the package.	It is created
       by a person or program and it directs the action of the swpackage
       utility.	 It is internal data unless released by the distributor.

       The files contain keywords (and values) to represent the attributes
       defined in the standard.	 There are three (3) different keyword types:
       object, attribute, and, extended. The object keyword type has no value
       and there are eleven (11) of these corresponding to the Software
       Definitions defined above: installed_software, distribution, media,
       bundle, vendor, category, product, subproduct, fileset, control_file,
       file.

       Each object keyword is followed by and newline and attributes in the
       form of keyword/value pairs.  Whitespace separates the keyword and
       value.  Whitespace outside of a quoted value is not significant.	 A
       quoted value can span multiple lines.  An object keyword with its list
       of attribute keywords (and values) forms a Software Definition.	A
       Software Definition is terminated by the start of the next Software
       Definition.  Extended keywords (meaning Extended Definitions) only
       appear in a PSF file.

       The order  of objects (i.e Software Definitions) is significant and a
       containment  hierarchy is determined according to parser's grammar.

   Additional Syntax Rules
	  *  A '#' (pound) character designates a comment.  A comment may
	     begin a line or appear at the end of a single line containing the
	     keyword/value pair.

	  *  A value may be quoted by the '"' (double quote) character; and,
	     multi-line values must be quoted.	Trailing white space from an
	     unquoted value will be removed.

	  *  The order of attributes is not significant although the INDEX
	     file grammar requires the layout_version attribute appear first
	     in distribution or installed software object.

	  *  The ", #, and, \ characters must be escaped with a backslash (\)
	     in a quoted value.

	  *  If a value begins with a &lt; (less than), the value is interpreted
	     as a filename whose contents will be treated as a quoted value
	     although the storage of the attribute will be in the form of a
	     control file (i.e. a separate file in the control directory).
	     For INDEX files, the filename is relative to the control
	     directory in which this attribute is contained.  For PSF files,
	     the filename is a path on the host.

   Software Definition File Grammar
       A PSF may contain all Software Definitions.  An INDEX file does not
       contain control_file, or file definitions. An INFO file contains only
       control_file, and file definitions.

	    software_definition_file : INDEX

SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS
       This section describes attribute usage and conventions imposed by the
       swbis implementation.  Not all attributes are listed here.  Those that
       are have important effects or particular interest.

   o Distribution Attributes
       The standard defines a limited set of attributes for the distribution
       object.	An expanded set is suggested by the informative annex however
       a conforming implementation is not required act on them.	 The reason
       for this is a distribution may be acted upon by a conforming utility in
       such a way that attributes of the distribution become invalid.  For
       this reason, some attributes that refer to an entire "package" [in
       other package managers] are referred from the product object and attain
       their broadened scope by the distributor's convention that their
       distribution contains just one product.

       For example, the package NAME and VERSION are referred from the product
       tag and revision, not the distribution's.  This convention supports
       multiple products in a distribution and is consistent with the
       standard.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the
	      distribution.  Providing a distribution tag is optional.	The
	      swbis implementation will use this as the [single] path name
	      prefix if there is no distribution.control_directory attribute.
	      A distribution tag attribute and swpackage's response to it is
	      an implementation extension.  The leading package path can also
	      be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.


       control_directory

	      control_directory, in a distribution object, is the constant
	      leading package path.  Providing this attribute is optional.  A
	      distribution control_directory attribute and swpackage's
	      response to it is an implementation extension.  The leading
	      package path can also be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.
	      This attribute will be generated by swpackage if not set in a
	      PSF.


   o Bundle Attributes
       A bundle defines a collection of products whether or not the
       distribution has all the products present.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the bundle.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  If it is not
	      present the product tag is used.


   o Product Attributes
       A product defines the software product.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the product.
	      This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
	      component in the installed software catalog.  It is required.
	      The swbis implementation uses it in a way that is analogous to
	      the RPMTAG_NAME attribute, namely as the public recognizable
	      name of the package.


       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the distribution under which the
	      product contents are located.  This value has no affect on the
	      installed software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then
	      the tag is used.


       revision

	      Is the product revision.	It should not contain a "RELEASE"
	      attribute part or other version suffix modifiers.	 This value is
	      used by the swbis implementation as a path name component in the
	      installed software catalog.  It is required by swinstall.


       vendor_tag

	      This is a short identifying name of the distributor that
	      supplied the product and may associate (refer to) a vendor
	      object from the INDEX file that has a matching tag attribute.
	      This attribute is optional.  This attribute value should strive
	      to be unique among all distributors. The swbis implementation
	      modifies the intended usage slightly as a string that strives to
	      be globally unique for a given product.tag and product.revision.
	      In this capacity it serves to distinguish products with the same
	      revision and tag from the same or different distributor.	It
	      most closely maps to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or "debian_revision"
	      attributes.  It is one of the version distinguishing attributes
	      of a product specified by the standard.  It is transfered into
	      the installed_software catalog (not as a path name component) by
	      swinstall.  If this attribute exists there should also be a
	      vendor object in the PSF in the distribution object that has
	      this tag.	 This attribute is assigned the value of
	      RPMTAG_RELEASE by swpackage when translating an RPM.


       architecture

	      This string is one of the version attributes.  It is used to
	      disambiguate products that have the same tag, revision and
	      vendor_tag.  It is not used for determining a products
	      compatibility with a host.  The form is implementation defined.
	      swbis uses the output of GNU config.guess as the value of this
	      string.  A wildcard pattern should not be used.  The canonical
	      swbis architecture string can be listed with swlist. For example

	      swlist -a architecture @ localhost

	       Here are some example outputs from real systems.

		  System      `uname -srm`		architecture
	      Red Hat 8.0:  Linux 2.4.18 i686	     i686-pc-linux-gnu
	      OpenSolaris:  SunOS 5.11 i86pc	     i386-pc-solaris2.11
	      NetBSD 3.1:   NetBSD 3.1 i386	     i386-unknown-netbsdelf3.1
	      Red Hat 4.1:  Linux 2.0.36 i586	     i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1
	      Debian 3.1:   Linux 2.6.8-2-386 i686   i686-pc-linux-gnu



       os_name os_release os_version machine_type

	      These attributes are used to determine compatibility with a
	      host.  They correspond to the uname attributes defined by
	      POSIX.1.	If an value is nil or non-existent it is assumed to
	      match the host.  All attributes must match for there to be
	      compatibility.  Distributors may wish to make these values a
	      shell pattern in their PSF's so to match the intended collection
	      of hosts.	 swbis uses fnmatch (with FLAGS=0) to determine a
	      match.


   o Fileset Attributes
       A fileset defines the fileset.

       tag

	      tag is the short, file system friendly, name of the fileset.  It
	      is required although selection of filesets is  not yet supported
	      therefore the end user will have little to do with the fileset
	      tag.

       control_directory

	      Is the directory name in the product under which the fileset
	      contents are located.  This value has no affect on the installed
	      software catalog.	 If it is not given in a PSF then the tag is
	      used.

   o Example Source Package PSF
       This PSF packages every file is current directory. It uses nil control
       directories so the package structure does not change relative to a
       vanilla tarball.

	distribution
	  description "fooit - a program from fooware
       that does everything."
	  title "fooit - a really cool program"
	  COPYING &lt; /usr/local/fooware/legalstuff/COPYING
	vendor
	  the_term_vendor_is_misleading false
	  tag fooware
	  title fooware Consultancy Services, Inc.
	  description ""
	vendor
	  the_term_vendor_is_misleading true
	  tag myfixes1
	  title Bug fixes, Set 1
	  description "a place for more detailed description"
	product
	  tag fooit
	  control_directory ""
	  revision 1.0
	  vendor_tag myfixes1  # Matches the vendor object above
	fileset
	   tag fooit-SOURCE
	   control_directory ""
	   directory .
	   file *
	   exclude catalog



   o Example Runtime (Binary) Package PSF
       This is a sample PSF for a runtime package.  It implies multiple
       products (e.g. sub-packages) using the bundle.contents attribute.
       Since the bundle and product tags exist in a un-regulated namespace and
       are seen by end users they should be carefully chosen.	Note that the
       bundle and product have the same tag which may force downstream users
       to disambiguate using software selection syntax such as fooit,bv=* or
       fooit,pv=* .

	distribution
	  description "fooit - a program from fooware
       that does everything."
	  title "fooit - a really cool program"
	  COPYING &lt; /usr/local/fooware/legalstuff/COPYING

	    vendor
	       the_term_vendor_is_misleading false
	       tag fooware
	       title fooware Consultancy Services, Inc.
	       description "Provider of the programs
	that do everything"

	    vendor
	       the_term_vendor_is_misleading true
		tag fw0
		title fooware fixes
		description "More fixes from the fooware users"

       #  Bundle definition:  Use a bundle
	    bundle

     <dl>
<dt>Distribution<dd>This refers to the package in either a directory form (unpacked) or
a serial archive form (e.g. a compressed tarball).  A distribution
is always in the form of the POSIX software packaging layout.

     <br><dt>Exported Catalog Structure<dd>This refers to the first portion of the distribution, the portion
of the distribution that is contained in the <samp><span class="file">catalog</span></samp> directory.

     <br><dt>File Storage Structure<dd>This refers to the second portion of the distribution, the portion
that is not the catalog portion but follows it.  The control directory
names for products and filesets are repeated from the Exported Catalog Structure
and serve to segregate and annotate the files that make up the fileset.

     <br><dt>Installed Software<dd>This refers abstractly to installed software files and installed software catalog.

     <br><dt>Installed Software Catalog<dd>This refers to the catalog of installed software.  The form
of this catalog is not specified by the standard.

     <br><dt>software_spec<dd>A software_spec follows a specific syntax of dot separated tags
optionally followed by a comma (,) and then a comma separated list of
version identifiers.

     <br><dt>Software Selection<dd>A software selection has the form of a software_spec. 
A Software Selection appears before the '@' and the targets
on the command lines.

     <br><dt>Target<dd>A target specifies a host and file name on the host.  The GNU implementation
also supports a syntax to specify a user name on the host.  A list of one or more
targets is given after a single '@' and are the the last arguments on the command line.

The configuration file is called a defaults file.  The defaults file contains
extended options which also can be specified using the '-x' option.

   <p>There are two (2) defaults files, the POSIX file named <samp><span class="file">swdefaults</span></samp> and the
swbis specific file named <samp><span class="file">swbisdefaults</span></samp>.  The swbis extension options all
begin with "swbis_".

   <p>For all users the following config file values are recommended (these are
the builtin defaults):

<pre class="verbatim">

<h2 class="chapter">3 Introduction</h2>

<p>You are reading about GNU Swbis, the GNU implementation of the
POSIX Software Administration Standard ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999
(formerly IEEE Std 1387.2-1995).  This spec describes a interchange
format, package file layout, meta-data file format and utilities for
package creation, installation, query, listing, and verification.

   <p>The GNU implementation adds capabilities for package authentication
using strong cryptographic digests and GPG signatures that are embedded
in the package as an ordinary control files as allowed by the standard.

   <p>The GNU implementation is compatible with traditional free software
distribution package file layouts by supporting empty names for
control directories in the POSIX layout.  This makes a swbis package
no different from current packages except for the addition of the
meta-data directory.

   <p>Other features of the GNU implementation are direct use of GNU Privacy
Guard for signature creation and verification, direct use of the Ssh client
for remote host operations, GNU tar format compatibility, no new utility or
program requirements for remote installation beyond POSIX compatible GNU
utilities that are probably already present on all GNU and GNU/Linux hosts.

   <p>GNU Swbis also can translate and install packages in RPM format.

<h2 class="unnumbered">Making PSFs for Package Creation</h2>

<p>The input file to <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>is a called a Product Specification File
or PSF. 
It contains information to direct <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> and information that is
package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged into the global
INDEX file].

   <p>A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs)
and Extended Definitions (See <a href="sw.html#EXTENDED-DEFINITIONS">(swbis_sw)EXTENDED DEFINITIONS</a>.)  An object keyword connotes
a logical object or software structure supported by the standard.  An
object keyword does not have a value field after it, as it contains
attributes and Extended Definitions.  An attribute keyword conotes an
attribute (i.e. keyword/value pair) and always has a value.

   <p>Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and
are transferred into the INDEX file.  Object keywords not recognized by
the standard are not allowed and will generate an error.  Extended
Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created
by swpackage).  Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into
object keywords (objects) and attributes recognized by the standard.

   <p>Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the
swbis implementation of <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>.

   <p>The file syntax is the same as a INDEX, or INFO file. 
See <a href="sw.html#SOFTWARE-DEFINITION-FILES">(swbis_sw)SOFTWARE DEFINITION FILES</a>.

   <p>A PSF may contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended
definitions.

   <p>Currently, <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> does not enforce requirements for
revision and name meta-data that other the 'swinstall' might need. 
Therefore you should perform a test install of your package. The preview '-p' option
of <samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp> internally simulates most of the install operation
but does not alter the file system.  The example below previews the package
on standard input.
<pre class="example">             swinstall -p -x verbose=6 -s - &lt; your_package
</pre>
   <p>Other restrictions of the swbis implementation are the default values for
the 'dfiles' and 'pfiles' attributes (which are 'dfiles' and 'pfiles') must
be used for minimal layout packages, i.e. packages that have the product and fileset
control directories specified as empty strings (i.e have a minimal package layout).

<h2 class="unnumbered">Host Requirements</h2>

<p>'swbis' is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible and
this applies to host requirements which are minimal.

   <p>For package creation you need <samp><span class="command">uuidgen</span></samp> and if creating signed
distributions you need <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp>.

   <p>For package installation you need
<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">dd</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">hostname</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">mkdir</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">expr</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">test</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">sleep</span></samp>.

   <p>Installation of packages on remote hosts (i.e. using swinstall with a remote host target)
does not require swbis to be installed there.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">swverify</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> commands are shell scripts which may have additional
requirements.

   <p>Here are the technical details about requirements for <samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp>, the same
apply to <samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp>:

   <p><samp><span class="command">swinstall</span></samp> requires a POSIX shell accessible by the remote shell command. 
This is the remote command run by ssh (or rsh)  for  all  operations. 
This command can be controlled by the &ndash;shell-command option or
the swbis_shell_command defaults file  option.  The recommended value is 'detect'
which performs auto-detection of a sutable shell.

   <p>Other utilities required to be in $PATH on the remote host are: dd, pax
(or GNU tar), hostname, mkdir, expr, echo, test, sleep, read (if not builtin).

<h2 class="unnumbered">Signing File System Directories</h2>

<p>To swbis, a signed directory is any directory that contains
the GPG signed distribution catalog directory <samp><span class="file">./catalog/</span></samp>.  The signature
protects the signed bytes which is a tar archive representation
of <samp><span class="file">./catalog/</span></samp>.  The contents of directory <samp><span class="file">./catalog/</span></samp> contain
meta data about the contents of the current directory <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp>.

   <p>Used is this way, the distribution catalog directory, <samp><span class="file">./catalog/</span></samp>, is
a GPG signed directory manifest.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">./catalog/</span></samp> directory is created by <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>.  A separate
ad-hoc utility, <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> makes signing a directory much easier.

<h2 class="unnumbered">Creating a Catalog of Installed Packages</h2>

<p>Suppose your distribution uses a packaging format that does not
provide an installed software catalog.  Using swbis you can
create your own provided you have the original package files.

   <p>To do this you translate the orignal package (that is already installed)
to swbis format and install just the catalog.  Like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
      swinstall --justdb -s- @/
</pre>

   <p>which writes that catalog at <samp><span class="file">/var/lib/swbis/catalog</span></samp>.  You can control
the location of the catalog via the command line option.

<pre class="verbatim">
      swinstall --justdb -x installed_software_catalog=/$HOME/my_catalog
</pre>

   <p>Translation is done by the <samp><span class="command">lxpsf</span></samp> utility.  It can be invoked transparently
using <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> and sent via a pipe to swinstall:

<pre class="verbatim">
        swpackage --to-swbis -s /Your/system/somepackage-1.0.type |
        swinstall --justdb
</pre>

   <p>Then the catalog can be queried and used for verification purposes.

<pre class="verbatim">
     swlist somepackage;  # list the package 
     swlist;   # list all the installed software
     swverify --sig-level=0 -vv somepackage @ / ;  # Use sig-level=1 if you
                                                      # signed the package
</pre>

   <p>This works really well for RPM distributions.  Users of Debian and Slackware
may want to take more detailed control to exclude extraneous system directories
that hamper clean verification.  Like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
     lxpsf --psf-form3  --exclude-system-dirs somepackage-1.0.tar.xz |
     swpackage -Wsource=- -s @PSF @- | # Use special options to swpackage
     swinstall --justdb
</pre>

   <p>Then verify.  Slackware users may use the specific option to ignore the
<samp><span class="file">./install</span></samp> directory and its files.

<pre class="verbatim">
     swlist;
     swverify --ignore-slack -x check_volatile=no somepackage @ /
</pre>

   <p>All of package signing and security options are available when using
swpackage as shown above.  In fact it was assumed that they were all
on by default.  Creating a catalog without signatures or file
digests or file list is of little use.  Here is a last example
showing some of these options.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">lxpsf</span></samp> is located in the LIBEXEC directory, for example
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/swbis/lxpsf</span></samp>.

<pre class="verbatim">
    lxpsf --psf-form3  --exclude-system-dirs somepackage-1.0.tar.xz |
    swpackage \
       --files \
       --sha2  \
       --sha1  \
       --sign  \
       --passphrase=fd=agent \
       --gpg-name=NAME \
       -Wsource=- -s @PSF @- |
     swinstall --justdb
</pre>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Translating and Installing Other Formats</h2>

<p>Translation of supported formats are done in memory. No temporary files are
created.  Large RPMs or RPMs with many small files may take many seconds
or several minutes to translate.

   <p>Translation is performed by the swbis library executable <samp><span class="command">lxpsf</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>.  Internally, this is
<pre class="verbatim">
     /usr/lib/swbis/lxpsf --psf-form3 -H ustar |
     swpackage -Wsource=- -s@PSF @-
</pre>

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">lxpsf</span></samp> is the only swbis program with RPM library dependencies, and
this is the program that does the actual meta-data translation.

   <p>The easiest way to invoke translation is with the <samp><span class="option">--unrpm</span></samp> of
<samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">swcopy</span></samp>.
<pre class="verbatim">
       swcopy --unrpm -s - @- &lt;your-0.1.arch.rpm | tar tvf -
           -or-
       swpackage --unrpm @- &lt;your-0.1.arch.rpm | tar tvf -
           -or-
       swpackage --to-sw &lt;your-0.1.arch.rpm | tar tvf -
</pre>

   <p>To verbosely preview the translated RPM:
<pre class="verbatim">
       swcopy --unrpm -s - @- | swinstall -p -x verbose=5
</pre>

<p>swbis is network transparent from the ground up.  It uses ssh (or rsh) to
establish remote connections.  Communication then takes place on standard
input, output and error as established by the remote shell client on the
local host.  Operations which are entirely local are symmetric with
remote operations in that swbis communicates via Unix pipes and makes
no distinction based on the locality of the communication endpoints.

   <p>swbis uses the ssh client program 'ssh' as found by the PATH variable. 
swbis adds the '-T' option to disable pseudo-tty allocation.

   <p>swbis supports an extension to the POSIX target syntax to support
multiple host hops.  Use of password authentication for multi-hop
targets requires use of the SSH_ASKPASS program and redirection
of X11 connections over the secure ssh channel.  See the 'ForwardX11'
option in the ssh client configuration.  Use of public key authentication
is more reliable since the authentication agent is forwarded by use of
the '-A' ssh option.

   <p>Important Note:  When making a multi-hop connection
using either authentication method, the authentication credentials appear
on the intermediate hosts and are subject to hijack, hence, the intermediate
hosts' trust requirement should be no less than the terminal host's.

<p>One overriding design goal of swbis is zero re-invention.  To that
end, swbis uses '/usr/bin/gpg' for signing and authentication.  It uses
'rsh' and 'ssh' for remote connections.  It uses 'bash' (as a POSIX shell)
for command processing. 
It uses 'pax' or 'tar' for archive installation. 
It uses a file system directory structure as the database for installed
software.

<p>swbis is non-intrusive relative to current practice
for data interchange and storage using tar archives.

   <p>swbis supports a 'minimal package layout'
(See <a href="sw.html#Minimal-Package-Layout">(swbis_sw)Minimal Package Layout</a>.) 
This layout follows the POSIX spec but has nil control directories
(Note: nil control directories are not attested to in the POSIX specification).

   <p>By specifying control directories as empty strings and specifying a non-empty
leading directory for the archive, a swbis POSIX package may be used
inter-changeably with free software tar archive source packages which commonly
have a leading package directory.

   <p>Binary (run-time) packages follow the same pattern except the leading
directory is specified as an empty string as well.  The result is a run-time
package directly installable by <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>.

   <p>The non-inventive nature of swbis extends into the format level as well. 
swbis has its own archive writing utility, <samp><span class="command">swpackage</span></samp>, and it is
self contained, however, it writes tar archives which are identical to
archives produced by GNU tar.

   <p>This data format mimicry has several advantages.  It forms the basis for
a very brittle regression test, namely bit-for-bit sameness with GNU tar. 
This also preserves symmetry between a package archive and package directory in
that swbis archives installed with tar can be repackaged with GNU tar with no
bit-wise change relative to the original.

   <p>Together, these layers of mimicry are put to practical application
in the <samp><span class="command">swign</span></samp> program See <a href="swign_1.html">(swbis_swign)</a>, which
creates GPG signed POSIX packages without any data copying except by GNU tar.

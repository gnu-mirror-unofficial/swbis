</pre><h3><a name="NAME"><b>NAME</b></a></h3><pre>       swcopy -- Copy POSIX and RPM packages.
</pre><h3><a name="SYNOPSIS"><b>SYNOPSIS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swcopy</b> [-p] [-s <i>source</i><b>_</b><i>file</i>] [-f <i>file</i>] [-t <i>targetfile</i>] \
       [-x <i>option=value</i>] [-X <i>options</i><b>_</b><i>file</i>] [-W <i>option</i>] \
       [software_selections] [@target [target1...]]

</pre><h3><a name="DESCRIPTION"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swcopy</b> copies a POSIX distribution from a source archive or directory
       to a target archive directory.  Neither swcopy nor any component of
       swbis is required on the target host, however, the target host must
       look like a Unix system at the shell and command-line utility level.
       Remote network connections are made by ssh.  Ssh is the default but rsh
       can be selected by a command line option.

       Before and during data transfer to the target, the distribution is
       audited.  Package auditing includes parsing the INDEX and INFO meta-
       data files.  The package pathnames are checked for consistency with a
       valid layout.  <b>swcopy</b> can be made to operate on arbitrary data or
       archives not in POSIX format by using the --no-audit option.  By
       default and with no external influences (i.e. swdefaults file) swcopy
       will read a archive on stdin and write an audited archive on stdout.
       The uncompressed audited output file will be identical to the
       uncompressed input file unless an error occurs.  Compressed archives
       that are audited will be re-compressed in the same format, however, the
       resulting file may not be identical to the input file (i.e. date,
       filename, and other stored data in the compressed format will be
       different).

       <b>swcopy</b> operates on serial archives (e.g. compressed tar archives) or on
       file system directories.  It will attempt to preserve the form (archive
       or directory) and compression state of the source object.  An exception
       is &quot;.&quot; as a target (See Implementation Extensions below).
</pre><h3><a name="OPTIONS"><b>OPTIONS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>-f FILE</b>

              Reads software_selections from FILE. (Not implemented).

       <b>-p</b>

              Preview the operation. Information is written to stdout.  The
              target is not written and no remote connections are established.


       <b>-s SOURCE</b>

              Specify the source file SOURCE, &quot;-&quot; is standard input.  The
              syntax is the same as for a target.  SOURCE may be a directory
              or archive file.

       <b>-t targetfile</b>

              Specify a file containing a list of targets (one per line).

       <b>-x option=value</b>

              Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       <b>-X FILE</b>

              Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
              default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
              the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
              any options file is disabled.

       <b>-v</b>

              Given one time it is identical to -x verbose=2.  This option can
              be given multiple times with increasing effect.  (Implementation
              extension option).
              -v  is level 2, -vv is level 3,... etc.
                  level 0: silent on stdout and stderr.
                  level 1: fatal and warning messages to stderr.
              -v  level 2: level 1 plus a progress bar.
              -vv level 3: level 2 plus script stderr.
              -vvv level 4: level 3 plus events.
              -vvvv level 5: level 4 plus events.
              -vvvvv level 6: level 5 plus set shell -vx option.
              -vvvvvv level 7 and higher: level 6 plus debugging messages.
               The progress meter is suppressed if swcopy is using stdout for
              data.

       <b>-b SIZE</b>

              Set block size, same as --block-size=N (Implementation extension
              option).

       <b>--version, -V</b>

              Show version (Implementation extension)

       <b>--help</b>

              Show help (Implementation extension)

       <b>-W option[,option,...]</b>

              Specify the implementation extension option.
              Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
              Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
              extension options may also be given individually using the
              '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       <b>-W no-audit</b>

              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_no_audit</b>
              Do not audit the transferred file.  This allows copying of
              arbitrary data.

       <b>-W audit</b>

              Do audit the transferred file.  Useful for overriding
              swbisdefaults file.

       <b>-W block-size=SIZE</b>

              SIZE is number of octets.

       <b>-W login</b>

              Establishes a interactive shell on the (remote) target host.
              Intended for debugging/verifying ssh operation.

       <b>-W gzip</b>

              Compress output using gzip.

       <b>-W bzip</b>

              Compress output using bzip2.

       <b>-W extract</b>

              Install the source using the archive reading utility at the
              target.

       <b>-W create</b>

              Force copy as a tar archive

       <b>-W no-extract</b>

              For installation to a file, not as a tar archive to be
              extracted.

       <b>-W pty</b>

              Do use pseudo-tty.  The system Ptys are only used for the
              --login feature.  A warning is emitted to stderr which says that
              the usage may be insecure.

       <b>-W no-pty</b>

              Do not use pseudo-tty.  The system Ptys are only used by default
              for the --login feature, otherwise they are not used and this
              option would have no effect.  If ptys are used a warning is
              emitted to stderr which says that the usage may be insecure.

       <b>-W uncompress</b>

              Write output archive that is uncompressed.

       <b>-W remote-shell=SHELL</b>

              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_remote_shell_client</b>
              Supported shells are &quot;ssh&quot; and &quot;rsh&quot;, ssh is the default.

              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_quiet_progress_bar</b>
              Disable progress bar, which is active for verbose levels 2 and
              higher (i.e. -v).

       <b>-W show-progress</b>

              Enables progress bar.(i.e. -v).

       <b>-W show-options-files</b>
              Show the complete list of options files and if they are found.

       <b>-W show-options</b>
              Show the options after reading the files and parsing the command
              line options.

       <b>-W pax-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}</b>
              Set the portable archive command for all operations.  The
              default is &quot;pax&quot;.

       <b>-W pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}</b>
              Set the read command for local and remote hosts.

              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_remote_pax_read_command</b>
              Set the read command for remote hosts.  This is the command that
              runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
              &quot;pax&quot;.

       <b>-W local-pax-read-command={tar|pax|star|gtar}</b>
              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_local_pax_read_command</b>
              Set the read command for local hosts.  This is the command that
              runs on the target (e.g. pax -r, tar xpf -).  The default is
              &quot;pax&quot;.

       <b>-W pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}</b>
              Set the write command for local and remote hosts.  This is the
              command that runs on the target (e.g. pax -w, tar cf -).

              Set the portable archive write command for local host
              operations.  This is the command that runs on the source (e.g.
              pax -w, tar cf -).  The default is &quot;pax&quot;.

       <b>-W remote-pax-write-command={tar|pax|star|gtar|swbistar}</b>

       <b>-W no-defaults</b>
              Do not read any defaults files.

       <b>-W no-remote-kill</b>
              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_no_remote_kill</b>
              Disables the use of a second remote connection to tear down the
              first in the event of SIGINT or SIGTERM or SIGPIPE.  Only has
              effect if the number of ssh hops is greater than 1.  A single
              host remote connection (ssh hop = 1) never uses a second remote
              connection.

       <b>-W no-getconf</b>
              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_no_getconf</b>

              specifies the command run by the remote shell.  The default is
              &quot;detect&quot;.

       <b>-W use-getconf</b>
              Opposite of --no-getconf.

       <b>-W allow-rpm</b>
              Defaults File Option: <b>swbis_allow_rpm</b>
              Allows detection and translation of RPMs.  (--audit must also be
              set.)

       <b>-W unrpm</b>
              Turns on options --allow-rpm and --audit.

       <b>-W source-script-name=NAME</b>
              Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
              to NAME.  This is useful for debugging.

       <b>-W target-script-name=NAME</b>
              Write the script that is written into the remote shell's stdin
              to NAME.  This is useful for debugging.

       <b>software_selections</b>

              Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) on which to
              be operated. (Not implemented).  The implementation defined
              behavior for no selections is to operate on the entire
              distribution.


       <b>target</b>

              Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
              are to be applied.  Allows specification of host and pathname
              where the software collection is located.  A target that
              contains only one part is assumed to be a hostname.  To force
              interpretation as a path, use a absolute path or prefix with
              ':'.


       Source and Target Specification and Logic

            Synopsis:
                 Posix:
                      host[:path]
                      host
                      host:
                      /path  # Absolute path

                 Swbis Extension:
                      [user@]host[:path]
                      [user@]host_port[:path]
                      :path

                 Swbis Multi-hop Target Extension:
                      # ':' is the target delimiter
                   # '_' delimits a port number in the host field

                      [user@]host[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]
                      [user@]host_port[@@[user@]host[@@...]][:file]

                      # Using ':', a trailing colon is used to
                      # disambiguate between a host and file.
                   # For Example,
                      :file
                      host:
                      host
                      host:file
                      host:host:
                      host_port:host_port:
                      host:host:file
                      user@host:user@host:
                      user@host:user@host:host:
                      user@host:user@host:file

            A more formal description:

            target : HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
                   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING ':'
                   | HOST_CHARACTER_STRING
                   | PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING
                   | ':' PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING   # Impl extension
                   ;

              PATHNAME_CHARACTER_STRING must be an absolute path unless
                              a HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is given.  Allowing
                              a relative path is a feature of the swbis
                              implementation.

                       NOTE: A '.' as a target is an implementation
                             extension and means extract in current
                             directory.

                       NOTE: A '-' indicating stdout/stdin is an
                             implementation extension.

                       NOTE: A ':' in the first character indicates a filename.
                             This is an implementation extension.

              HOST_CHARACTER_STRING is an IP or hostname.

           Examples:
              Copy the  distribution /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz at 192.168.1.10
                     swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz @192.168.1.10:/root

</pre><h3><a name="TARGET COPYING RULES"><b>TARGET COPYING RULES</b></a></h3><pre>   <b>Rules</b>
       If a target directory on the host does not exist it will be created
       using mkdir -p using the file creation mask of the originating swcopy
       process.  A trailing slash in the target spec signifies that the last
       path component should be a directory.  A source spec that is a
       directory will be created on the target as a directory with the same
       name in the target directory.  If the source spec is stdin then the
       existence of directories in the target spec and a trailing slash in the
       target spec path determines whether the created file will be a regular
       file or directory, that is, stdin will be copied as a file unless the
       last target path component is a directory or ends in a slash '/'.  If
       the source spec is a regular file, the source basename will be used as
       the basename in the target if the last target path component is a
       directory or ends in a slash '/', otherwise, the target basename is the
       last path component of the target spec.  The implementation option
       --extract biases these rules to install using the archive reading
       command (e.g.  pax -r).

   <a name="Examples"><b>Examples</b></a>
              Copy a regular file via tar archive creation and extraction.
              This will preserve the permissions of the file to the extent tar
              can preserve them.

                swcopy --no-audit --create --extract -s :README @ HostA

               Copy a directory to another host

                swcopy --no-audit  -s /usr @ HostA:/usr/local/tmp/HostA/

               Copy several directories to another host as a compressed
              archive file.

                  swcopy --no-audit --no-extract \
                           -s /usr -s /etc @ HostA:/tmp/usr-etc.tar.bz2

               Install a tarball in the current directory: Note: Must use
              stdin as source and &quot;.&quot; as the target.

                   swcopy --no-audit -s - @. &lt; foo.tar.gz

               Copy thru a firewall:

                          swcopy -s /var/tmp/foo.tar.gz \
                               @root@host1:root@host2:/var/tmp

               Copy Stdin to a remote host:

                  Unpack the archive on stdin in the directory
                  /a/b/c if 'c' is a directory, otherwise copy
                  the archive file to a file named 'c' in
                  directory /a/b creating it if possible and
                  overwriting if required.
                      swcopy -s - @host1:/a/b/c

               Copy Stdin to a remote host:

                     Unpack the serial archive on stdin in the
                     directory /a/b/c if 'c' is a directory,
                     otherwise make the directory 'c' but fail if
                     directory 'c' cannot be created.
                         swcopy -s - @host1:/a/b/c/
                                   # Note trailing slash.

               Copy a regular file:

                 Copy file yy to directory /aa/bb/cc/ on the
                 remote host, creating it if required and possible.
                 If cc is a regular file then fail.
                    swcopy -s /xx/yy @host1:/aa/bb/cc/

               Copy a regular file thru intermediate host 'fw':

                     Copy file yy to home directory of user1 on host1
                     thru a an intermediate host fw,
                         swcopy -s /xx/yy @ fw:user1@host1:.

               Copy a directory from one host to another

                     Copy directory yy into directory cc if cc exists,
                     otherwise create cc and copy yy into it. If cc
                     is and copy as yy.
                         swcopy -s /xx/yy @host1:/aa/bb/cc
</pre><h3><a name="IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSIONS"><b>IMPLEMENTATION EXTENSIONS</b></a></h3><pre>   <b>Software Specification Targets</b>
       A dash '-' is supported and means stdout or stdin.  Operations with
       stdout and stdin on a remote host is not supported.

       A decimal '.' is supported and means the current directory.  This is
       supported for remote and non-remote targets.  If the source is standard
       input, the distribution will be unpacked (e.g. pax -r) in the directory
       '.'.  If the source is a regular file then a regular file in '.' will
       be created with the same name.

       Thus,

                  # swcopy -s `pwd`/myarchive.tgz @.  # Do NOT do this even
                                                      # though in most cases
                                                      # swcopy is a coward.

        will destroy the source file myarchive.tgz, whereas

                  # swcopy -s - @. &lt;`pwd`/myarchive.tgz

        will install it with the configured archive reading utility.



   <a name="RPM Translation"><b>RPM Translation</b></a>
       RPM (RedHat Package Manager) format packages are copied by first
       translating to an equivalent ISO/IEEE file layout in POSIX tar format
       and then copying as a POSIX package.  The RPM detection and translation
       occurs if the ''--allow-rpm'' option is on (either by the command line
       args or defaults file) and the ''--audit'' option is on.  If the
       ''--allow-rpm'' option is not set an error occurs.  If the ''--audit''
       is not set, the RPM is copied as arbitrary data and translation does
       not occur.

       Since translation is done on the local (management) host, RPM is not
       reqired on the remote (target) host.

       The translation is (internally) equivalent to :

          cat your-poor-poor-0.0.bin.rpm |
          /usr/lib/swbis/lxpsf --psf-form2 -H ustar |

</pre><h3><a name="BUGS"><b>BUGS</b></a></h3><pre>       Swcopy is subject to breakage if a user's account on an intermediate
       (or terminal) host in a target spec is not configured to use a Bourne
       compatible shell. (This breakage may be eliminated by use of the --no-
       getconf option as explained above.)

       A multiple ssh hop source spec  (more than 1 remote host involved in
       the source transfer) upon a SIGINT may result in sshd and ssh processes
       being left on on the intermediate host(s), this despite, swcopy's
       action of sending a SIGTERM to the remote script's parent process.

       Swcopy does not currently implement Software Selections nor the events
       of the Selection and Analysis Phases nor dependency copying nor fileset
       state transitions.  The Execution (copying) phase is done on the entire
       distribution by the utility selected in .../swbisdefaults which is
       <a href=pax_1.html>pax(1)</a> by default.  Pax is not found on all GNU/Linux systems.  Also,
       the pax version shipped with some (older) GNU/Linux systems mangles the
       pathname of files whose pathname is exactly 100 octets long.  Despite
       this pax is the the builtin default.  GNU tar is widely used and
       trusted but creates non-standard archives for long pathnames.  Perhaps
       the best compromise is to use star (with -H ustar header option)  for
       archive creation and (GNU) tar for archive reading.  If your
       environment is 100% GNU/Linux using GNU tar is safe (GNU tar 1.13.25 is
       recommended).  Swcopy does not support using the cpio utility since its
       archive writing interface is unlike pax and tar, although, future
       support is possible for archive reading.

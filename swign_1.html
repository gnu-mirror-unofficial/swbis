</pre><h3><a name="NAME"><b>NAME</b></a></h3><pre>       swign  -- Create a tar archive of a directory with an embedded GPG sig-
       nature.
</pre><h3><a name="SYNOPSIS"><b>SYNOPSIS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swign</b> [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @-

       <b>swign</b> [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @.

       <b>swign</b> -S [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir]
</pre><h3><a name="DESCRIPTION"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swign</b> loads the  './catalog/'  meta-data  directory  into  the  current
       directory  and  then,  using  GNU  tar  and the distribution file list,
       writes the archive to stdout.  The result  is  a  tar  archive  written
       entirely  with  GNU  tar that contains an embedded GPG signature in the
       control file './catalog/dfiles/signature'.  The  contents  of  './cata-
       log/'   are  consistent  with  the  POSIX  packaging  standard  ISO/IEC
       15068-2:1999.  The package layout of the resulting archive is unchanged
       except for the addition of the './catalog' directory.

       The  contents  of  the archive is the contents of the current directory
       &quot;.&quot;.  The pathnames in the archive are prefixed by  the  base  name  of
       &quot;.&quot;.   The  owner and group of all the files in the emitted archive are
       specified by the PSF file and command line options.

       In order for the signature to be valid, the file  ownerships  specified
       in  the  PSF  must  be consistent with the 'swign' command.  <b>swign</b> will
       read the PSF to  determine  these  ownerships  automatically  from  the
       'file_permissions'  directive  unless  the  '-o'  or  '-g' command line
       options are used or if this feature is disabled  using  the  '--no-psf-
       detect' option is given.

       The  default  ownerships for all the files are the current user's owner
       and group.  If the -o (or -g) option is used with a  empty  string  for
       the  option  arg then the file ownerships of the source files are used.
       This script assumes GNU tar is installed.

       After writing the ./catalog/ file and before writing the  archive,  the
       file  list  stored in ./catalog/dfiles/files is compared to the current
       directory contents, if any difference is found the archive is not writ-
       ten and error returned.

</pre><h3><a name="OPTIONS"><b>OPTIONS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>--help</b>
              show help.


       <b>--show-psf</b>
              show the PSF to stdout, and then exit.


       <b>--no-psf-detect</b>
              Disable automatic detection of the PSF's file ownerships policy.


       <b>--no-remove</b>
              Don't remove the ./catalog directory before overwriting.


       <b>-u, --local-user name</b>
              Use name as the user ID to sign.


       <b>--homedir=DIR</b>
              Set the name of the home directory to  DIR.   If  not  specified
              then use &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.


       <b>-s, --source=FILE</b>
              Specify  a  PSF or '-' for stdin.  If this is not given then the
              internally generated PSF  is  used.   The  PSF  is  scanned  for
              replacement  tokens  for  tag and revision attributes determined
              from the current directoy name. It is expected that the  current
              directory  name  have the form: 'tag-revision'.  The replacement
              string has the form '%__NAME' where NAME is 'tag' or 'revision'.


       <b>-T, --show-names-only</b>
              show some info (for help and debugging) and exit.


       <b>-t, --run-sanity-check</b>
              Instead  of  writing  stdout,  write  the  archive  to  ../pack-
              ageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz and run some sanity tests.


       <b>-S, --sign-this</b>
              Write the ./catalog/ file containing the  digest  and  signature
              into  &quot;.&quot;  and  then exit without writing the archive to stdout.
              Same as using &quot;.&quot; as the target such as 'swign @.'


       <b>-D, --with-checkdigest FILE</b>
              Include the checkdigest control script sourced from FILE.   This
              is  only  needed  when  not supplying a PSF, that is this option
              modifies an internally generated PSF.


       <b>-o, --owner OWNER</b>
              Specify owner.  Use an empty string &quot;&quot;  to  specify  the  source
              file owner.


       <b>-g, --group GROUP</b>
              Specify  group.   Use  an  empty string &quot;&quot; to specify the source
              file group.


       <b>-x format</b>
              Specify the archive format.  Must  be  one  of  the  formats  of
              swpackage.


       <b>@-</b>
              Target, only supported target is standard output.

</pre><h3><a name="EXTERNAL EFFECTS"><b>EXTERNAL EFFECTS</b></a></h3><pre>       The program will remove and replace a file in &quot;.&quot; named ./catalog/.
       Nothing outside of './catalog/' is modified.
       Standard output is the target for the tar archive.
       When  using  the  '-t'  option  an  archive file is written to ../pack-
       ageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz

       A copy of the PSF is made in /var/tmp/swign$$.  It is normally  created
       and erased by the program.

</pre><h3><a name="EXAMPLES"><b>EXAMPLES</b></a></h3><pre>       Show the internally generated PSF to stdout.  Change directory into the
       directory to package, then type

          swign --show-psf
               -or-
          swign -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf







       Generate the package (and verify it) using a PSF  that  you  supply  on
       standard  input.   Change directory into the directory to package, then
       type

          swign -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf | swign -s - -u &quot;gpgName&quot; @- | swverify -d @-






</pre><h3><a name="TESTING"><b>TESTING</b></a></h3><pre>       After running successfully with options <b>-S</b>  and <b>-D FILE</b>  the  following
       should be true (report no error).

                 swverify --checksig .   # Deprecated form
                     -or-
                 swverify -d @.     # Posix syntax






       Similarly,

                 swign -u &quot;your GPG Name&quot; @- | swverify --checksig -
                     -or-
                 swign -u &quot;your GPG Name&quot; @- | swverify -d @-


       If  a checkdigest script is included then you should unpack the package
       at a new location and run  swverify -d @. in  the  new  location.   The
       <b>checkdigest</b>  script  is a vendor extension control file that is part of
       the GPG signed ./catalog directory.   As  an  implementation  extension
       behavior  the <b>swverify</b> program will execute this script after verifica-
       tion of the signature.  The script may take any action at  this  point,
       but  the  intention  is  that  it be used to verify the contents of the
       package directory using GNU tools such as md5sum, sha1sum, and tar.

       If a <b>checkdigest</b> script is not included, then  the  package  user  will
       have  to manually execute the commands that would have been executed by
       the script using the file meta-data  in  an  authenticated  INFO  file.
       When  verifying the unpacked directory form of a package,  the <b>swverify</b>
       program will return an error if the <b>checkdigest</b> script is not  present,
       though,  it  is  not  required for verification of the tar archive file
       itself using <b>swverify</b>.

       Swign can be used to sign any directory using the  file  ownerships  of
       the  source files.  The following commands act as a test of swpackage's
       ability to generate an archive identical to GNU tar.  (Note: the script
       checkdigest.sh is found in ./bin of the source distribution.)

              swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u &quot;Test User&quot; -o &quot;&quot; -g &quot;&quot; -S;
              swverify -d @.


</pre><h3><a name="PSF ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT"><b>PSF ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT</b></a></h3><pre>       A PSF that is provided using the '-s' option will be scanned for a spe-
       cial character sequence '%__NAME'  where NAME is either 'tag' or 'revi-
       sion'.  'tag' is replaced with the package name portion of the currrent
       directory.  'revision' is replaced with the version portion.

</pre><h3><a name="BUGS"><b>BUGS</b></a></h3><pre>       Symbolic links in a package are problematic for verifying the  unpacked
       form  of  a package since the modification time is not preserved.  They
       have no affect on verification of the tar archive  file  using  'swver-
       ify'.

       If  a  directory  is  signed  using the '-S' option and has a file path
       greater than 99 chars in length then it will  be  unverifiable  if  the
       'ustar0' format and GNU tar 1.13.25 was used.

       Verification  of  the  directory  form  of  a  distribution  (i.e.  the
       installed tarball path name prefix) such as running  'swverify  -d  @.'
       after running 'swign -S' will fail if the order of directory entries is
       not compatible with traditional Unix file system directory entry order-
       ing.   This  incompatibility  may be present in the Ext3, reiserFS, and
       DarwinOS et.al file systems.

       The file ownership policy of the PSF, the checkdigest script  (if  any)
       and  the  command  line options must agree.  The default file ownership
       policies of this program are suited to  packaged  products  where  file
       user and group ownerships are not a critical feature.



                                                                      <a href=swign_1.html>swign(1)</a>

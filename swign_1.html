</pre><h3><a name="NAME"><b>NAME</b></a></h3><pre>       swign -- Create a tar archive of a directory with an embedded GPG
       signature.
</pre><h3><a name="SYNOPSIS"><b>SYNOPSIS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swign</b> [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @- # Write to stdout

       <b>swign</b> [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir] @.  # Sign directory

       <b>swign</b> -S [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir]

       <b>swign</b> -E [options] [-u gpg-name] [--homedir=gpg-homedir]
</pre><h3><a name="DESCRIPTION"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swign</b> reads a PSF (Product Specfication File) to generate and load the
       package catalog into the current directory and then writes the
       cooresponding archive to stdout.  The PSF is read from standard input
       by default.  To use an internally generated PSF with name and revision
       attributes determined from the name of the current directory use '-s.'.

       The PSF is scanned for replacement tokens for tag and revision
       attributes determined from the current directoy name.  It is expected
       that the current directory name have the form: 'tag-revision'.  The
       replacement string has the form '%__NAME' where NAME is 'tag' or
       'revision'.  The directory derived values can be overridden with the
       '--revision' or '--name-version' options.

       <b>swign</b> by default will remove and re-create the ./catalog/ meta-data
       directory, then use GNU tar to write the current directory as a tar
       archive to stdout.  The result is a tar archive written entirely with
       GNU tar that contains an embedded GPG signature in the control file
       './catalog/dfiles/signature'.  The contents of './catalog/' are
       consistent with the POSIX packaging standard ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999.  The
       package layout of the resulting archive is unchanged except for the
       addition of the './catalog' directory.

       The contents of the archive is the contents of the current directory
       &quot;.&quot;.  The pathnames in the archive are prefixed by the base name of
       &quot;.&quot;.  The owner and group of all the files in the emitted archive are
       specified by the PSF file and command line options.

       In order for the signature to be valid, the file ownerships specified
       in the PSF must be consistent with the 'swign' command.  <b>swign</b> will
       read the PSF to determine these ownerships automatically from the
       'file_permissions' directive unless the '-o' or '-g' command line
       options are used or if this feature is disabled using the '--no-psf-
       detect' option is given.

       The default ownerships for all the files are the current user's owner
       and group.  If the -o (or -g) option is used with a empty string for
       the option arg then the file ownerships of the source files are used.
       This script assumes GNU tar is installed.

       After writing the ./catalog/ file and before writing the archive, the
       file list stored in ./catalog/dfiles/files is compared to the current
       directory contents, if any difference is found the archive is not
       written and error returned.

</pre><h3><a name="OPTIONS"><b>OPTIONS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>--help</b>
              show help.


       <b>--show-psf</b>
              show the PSF to stdout, and then exit.


       <b>--no-psf-detect</b>
              Disable automatic detection of the PSF's file ownerships policy.


       <b>--no-remove</b>
              Don't remove the ./catalog directory before overwriting.


       <b>--file-ownerships</b>
              Use the file ownerships and permissions of the source files.



       <b>-u, --local-user name</b>
              Use name as the user ID to sign.


       <b>--homedir=DIR</b>
              Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If not specified
              then use &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.


       <b>-s, --source=FILE</b>
              Specify a PSF file name or one of two special names, '-' for
              stdin, and '.' for the internally generated PSF.


       <b>-T, --show-names-only</b>
              show some info (for help and debugging) and exit.


       <b>-t, --run-sanity-check</b>
              Instead of writing stdout, write the archive to
              ../packageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz and run some sanity tests.


       <b>-S, --sign-only</b>
              Write the ./catalog/ file containing the digest and signature
              into &quot;.&quot; and then exit without writing the archive to stdout.
              Same as using &quot;.&quot; as the target such as 'swign @.'


       <b>-E, --emit-only</b>
              Do not write the ./catalog/ file containing the digest and
              signature into &quot;.&quot; and then write the archive to stdout.  This
              does not affect the directory contents.


       <b>-D, --with-checkdigest FILE</b>
              Include the checkdigest control script sourced from FILE.  This
              is only needed when not supplying a PSF, that is this option
              modifies an internally generated PSF.


       <b>-o, --owner OWNER</b>
              Specify owner.  Use an empty string &quot;&quot; to specify the source
              file owner.


       <b>-g, --group GROUP</b>
              Specify group.  Use an empty string &quot;&quot; to specify the source
              file group.


       <b>--name-version=NAME-REV</b>
              Specify a product tag and revision as dash delimited.


       <b>-r, --revision REV</b>
              Specify a product revision.  This will override a revision part
              of the current directory's name.


       <b>-x format</b>
              Specify the archive format.  Must be one of the formats of
              swpackage.


       <b>@-</b>
              Target, only supported target is standard output.

</pre><h3><a name="EXTERNAL EFFECTS"><b>EXTERNAL EFFECTS</b></a></h3><pre>       The program will remove and replace a file in &quot;.&quot; named ./catalog/.
       Nothing outside of './catalog/' is modified.
       Standard output is the target for the tar archive.
       When using the '-t' option an archive file is written to
       ../packageDirName.swigntest.tar.gz

       A copy of the PSF is made in /var/tmp/swign$$.  It is normally created
       and erased by the program.

</pre><h3><a name="EXAMPLES"><b>EXAMPLES</b></a></h3><pre>       Show the internally generated PSF to stdout.  Change directory into the
       directory to package, then type

          swign -s. --show-psf
          #
          # or specify a owner and group policy
          swign -s. -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf




       Create a signed metadata (i.e. catalog/) directory of a live directory,
       for example /bin

              swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u &quot;YourGPGNAME&quot; -o &quot;&quot; -g &quot;&quot; @.




       Generate the package (and verify it) using a PSF that you supply on
       standard input.  Change directory into the directory to package, then
       type

          swign -o 0 -g 0 --show-psf | swign -s - -u &quot;gpgName&quot; @- | swverify -d @-




       Example of directory signing and authentication.

          swign -u YourGPGName -s. --file-ownerships -D /HOME/checkdigest.sh --sign-only
          swverify -d @.
          swign  --file-ownerships -emit-only | swverify -d @-



</pre><h3><a name="TESTING"><b>TESTING</b></a></h3><pre>       After running successfully with options <b>-S</b>  and <b>-D FILE</b>  the following
       should be true (report no error).

                 swverify --checksig .   # Deprecated form
                     -or-
                 swverify -d @.     # POSIX syntax




       Similarly,

                 swign -u &quot;your GPG Name&quot; @- | swverify --checksig -
                     -or-
                 swign -u &quot;your GPG Name&quot; @- | swverify -d @-


       If a checkdigest script is included then you should unpack the package
       at a new location and run  swverify -d @. in the new location.  The
       <b>checkdigest</b> script is a vendor extension control file that is part of
       the GPG signed ./catalog directory.  As an implementation extension
       behavior the <b>swverify</b> program will execute this script after
       verification of the signature.  The script may take any action at this
       point, but the intention is that it be used to verify the contents of
       the package directory using GNU tools such as md5sum, sha1sum, and tar.

       If a <b>checkdigest</b> script is not included, then the package user will
       have to manually execute the commands that would have been executed by
       the script using the file meta-data in an authenticated INFO file.
       When verifying the unpacked directory form of a package,  the <b>swverify</b>
       program will return an error if the <b>checkdigest</b> script is not present,
       though, it is not required for verification of the tar archive file
       itself using <b>swverify</b>.

       Swign can be used to sign any directory using the file ownerships of
       the source files.  The following commands act as a test of swpackage's
       ability to generate an archive identical to GNU tar.  (Note: the script
       checkdigest.sh is found in ./bin of the source distribution.)

              swign -D $HOME/checkdigest.sh -u &quot;Test User&quot; -o &quot;&quot; -g &quot;&quot; -S;
              swverify -d @.


</pre><h3><a name="PSF ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT"><b>PSF ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT</b></a></h3><pre>       A PSF that is provided using the '-s' option will be scanned for a
       special character sequence '%__NAME'  where NAME is either 'tag' or
       'revision'.  'tag' is replaced with the package name portion of the
       currrent directory.  'revision' is replaced with the version portion.

</pre><h3><a name="BUGS"><b>BUGS</b></a></h3><pre>       Symbolic links in a package are problematic for verifying the unpacked
       form of a package since the modification time is not preserved.  They
       have no affect on verification of the tar archive file using
       'swverify'.

       If a directory is signed using the '-S' option and has a file path
       greater than 99 chars in length then it will be unverifiable if the
       'ustar0' format and GNU tar 1.13.25 was used.

       Verification of the directory form of a distribution (i.e. the
       installed tarball path name prefix) such as running 'swverify -d @.'
       after running 'swign -S' will fail if the order of directory entries is
       not compatible with traditional Unix file system directory entry
       ordering.  This incompatibility may be present in the Ext3, reiserFS,
       and DarwinOS et.al file systems.

       The file ownership policy of the PSF, the checkdigest script (if any)
       and the command line options must agree.  The default file ownership
       policies of this program are suited to packaged products where file
       user and group ownerships are not a critical feature.



                                                                      <a href=swign_1.html>swign(1)</a>

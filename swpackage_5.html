</pre><h3><a name="SYNOPSIS"><b>SYNOPSIS</b></a></h3><pre>       Output format - Data Interchange Formats
       Input format - Product Specification File (PSF)
</pre><h3><a name="SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT"><b>SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT</b></a></h3><pre>       The output format is either one of two formats specified in POSIX.1
       (ISO/IEC 9945-1) which are tar (header magic=ustar) or cpio (header
       magic=070707).  The default format of the swbis implementation is
       &quot;ustar&quot;.  The POSIX spec under specifies definitions for some of the
       ustar header fields.  The personality of the default swbis ustar format
       mimics GNU tar 1.15.1 and is designed to be compliant to POSIX.1.  The
       personality of the &quot;ustar0&quot; format mimics, for pathnames less than 99
       octets,  GNU tar 1.13.25 using the &quot;-b1 --posix&quot; options.  This bit-
       for-bit sameness does not exist for pathnames greater than 99 chars as
       swbis follows the POSIX spec and GNU tar 1.13.25 does not.  The
       &quot;ustar0&quot; ustar personality is deprecated.  It is only slightly
       different from 'ustar' in how device number fields are filled (with
       spaces, zeros or NULs) for non-device files.

       In addition the swbis implementation supports several other tar
       variants including bit-for-bit mimicry of GNU tar (1.13.25) default
       format which uses a non-standard name split and file type (type 'L').
       This format is known as '--format=oldgnu'.  Also supported is the gnu
       format of GNU tar 1.15.1 specified by '--format=gnu'

       The defacto cpio formats are also supported.  &quot;new ASCII&quot; (sometimes
       called SVR4 cpio) and &quot;crc&quot; cpio formats with header magic &quot;070701&quot; and
       &quot;070702&quot; respectively.

       Support for &quot;pax Interchange Format&quot; (Extended header tar) described in
       IEEE 1003.1-2001 under the &quot;pax&quot; manual page is planned.

       The entirety of the output byte stream is a single valid file of one
       the formats mentioned above.

       The swbis implementation writes its output to stdout.  The default
       output block size is 10240 bytes.  The last block is not padded and
       therefore the last <a href=write_2.html>write(2)</a> may be a short write.  The selected block
       size does not affect the output file contents.

       The swbis implementation is biased, in terms of capability and default
       settings, to the tar format.  Package signing is only supported in tar
       format.
</pre><h3><a name="SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT"><b>SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT</b></a></h3><pre>       The input file is called a product specification file or PSF.  It
       contains information to direct swpackage and information that is
       package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged into the global
       INDEX file].

       A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs) and
       Extended Definitions (described below).  An object keyword connotes a
       logical object (i.e. software structure) supported by the standard.  An
       object keyword does not have a value field after it, as it contains
       Attributes and Extended Definitions.  An attribute keyword conotes an
       attribute which is always in the form of a keyword/value pair.

       Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and are
       transferred into the INDEX file.  Object keywords not recognized by the
       standard are not allowed and will generate an error.  Extended
       Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created
       by swpackage).  Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into
       object keywords (objects) and attributes recognized by the standard.

       Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the swbis
       implementation of swpackage.

       The file syntax is the same as a <b>INDEX</b>, or <b>INFO</b> file.  A PSF may
       contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended
       definitions.

       For additional information see
       XDSA C701 <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm">http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm</a>, or
       sw manual page.

   <a name="EXTENDED DEFINITIONS"><b>EXTENDED DEFINITIONS</b></a>
       A Product Specification File (PSF) can contain Extended Definitions in
       the <b>fileset</b>, <b>product</b> or <b>bundle</b> software definitions.  They would have
       the same level or containment relationship as a <b>file</b> or <b>control_file</b>
       definition in the same contaning object.

       Extended Definitions represent a minimal, expressive form for
       specifying files and file attributes.  Their use in a PSF is optional
       in that an equivalent PSF can be constructed without using them,
       however, their use is encouraged for the sake of brevity and
       orthogonality.

       The swbis implementation requires that no [ordinary] attributes appear
       after Extended Definitions in the containing object, and, requires that
       Extended Definitions appear before logically contained objects.  That
       is, the parser uses the next object keyword to syntacticly and
       logically terminate the current object even if the current object has
       logically contained objects.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Extended Control File Definitions</b>
            checkinstall  <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            preinstall    <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            postinstall   <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            verify        <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            fix           <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            checkremove   <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            preremove     <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            postremove    <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            configure     <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            unconfigure   <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            request       <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            unpreinstall  <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            unpostinstall <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            space         <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            control_file  <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]


       The <i>source</i> attribute defines the location in distributors's development
       system where the swpackage utility will find the script.  The keyword
       is the value of the <i>tag</i> attribute and tells the utilities when to
       execute the script.  The <i>path</i> attribute is optional and specifies the
       file name in the packages distribution relative to the
       control_directory for software containing the script. If not given the
       <i>tag</i> value is used as the filename.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Directory Mapping</b>
          directory  <i>source</i>  [<i>destination</i>]


       Applies the <i>source</i> attribute as the directory under which the
       subsequently listed files are located.  If <i>destination</i> is defined it
       will be used as a prefix to the <i>path</i> (implied) file definition.  <i>source</i>
       is typically a temporary or build location and <i>dest</i> is its unrealized
       absolute pathname destination.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Recursive File Definition</b>
         file *


       Specifies every file in current source directory.  The <i>directory</i>
       extended definition must be used before the recursive specification.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Explicit File Definition</b>
         file [-t <i>type</i>] [-m <i>mode</i>] [-o <i>owner</i>[,<i>uid</i>]] [-g <i>group</i>[,<i>gid</i>]] [-n] [-v] source [<i>path</i>]


       <b>source</b>


              <i>source</i> defines the pathname of the file to be used as the source
              of file data and/or attributes.  If it is a relative path, then
              swpackage searches for this file relative to the the source
              argument of the <b>directory</b> keyword, if set.  If <b>directory</b> keyword
              is not set then the search is relative to the current working
              directory of the swpackage utility's invocation.

              All attributes for the destination file are taken from the
              source file, unless a <b>file_permissions</b> keyword is active, or the
              -m, -o, or -g options are also included in the file
              specification.

       <b>path</b>

              <i>path</i> defines the destination path where the file will be created
              or installed.  If it is a relative path, then the destination
              path of the of the <b>directory</b> keyword must be active and will be
              used as the path prefix.  If path is not specified then <i>source</i>
              is used as the value of path and directory mapping applied (if
              active).

       <b>-t type</b>

              <i>type</i> may one of 'd' (directory), or  'h' (hard link), or 's'
              (symbolic link).

              -t d  Create a directory.
              If <i>path</i> is not specified <i>source</i> is used as the path attribute.

              -t h  Create a hard link.
              <i>path</i> and <i>source</i> are specified.  <i>source</i> is used as the value of
              the <i>link</i><b>_</b><i>source</i> attribute, and <i>path</i> is the value of the path
              attribute.

              -t s  Create a symbolic link.
              <i>path</i> and <i>source</i> are specified.  <i>source</i> is used as the value of
              the <i>link</i><b>_</b><i>source</i> attribute, and <i>path</i> is the value of the path
              attribute.

       <b>-m mode</b>

              <i>mode</i> defines the octal mode for the file.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Default Permission Definition</b>
         file_permissions [-m <i>mode</i>] [-u <i>umask</i>] [-o [<i>owner</i>[,]][<i>uid</i>]] [-g [<i>group</i>[,]][<i>gid</i>]]


       Applies to subsequently listed file definitions in a fileset.  These
       attributes will apply where the file attributes were not specified
       explicitly in a file definition.  Subsequent <b>file_permissions</b>
       definitions simply replace previous definitions (resetting all the
       options).

       To reset the file_permission state (i.e. turn it off) use one of the
       following:
           file_permissions &quot;&quot;
            or the preferred way is
           file_permissions -u 000

   <b>o</b>  <b>Excluding Files</b>
          exclude source


       Excludes a previously included file or an entire directory.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Including Files</b>
          include &lt;<i>filename</i>


       The contents of <i>filename</i> may be more definitions for files.  The syntax
       of the included file is PSF syntax.


   <a name="SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS"><b>SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS</b></a>
       This section describes attribute usage and conventions imposed by the
       swbis implementation.  Not all attributes are listed here.  Those that
       are have important effects or particular interest.

   <b>o Distribution Attributes</b>
       The standard defines a limited set of attributes for the distribution
       object.  An expanded set is suggested by the informative annex however
       a conforming implementation is not required act on them.  The reason
       for this is a distribution may be acted upon by a conforming utility in
       such a way that attributes of the <b>distribution</b> become invalid.  For
       this reason, some attributes that refer to an entire &quot;package&quot; [in
       other package managers] are referred from the product object and attain
       their broadened scope by the distributor's convention that their
       distribution contains just one <b>product</b>.

       For example, the package NAME and VERSION are referred from the product
       tag and revision, not the distribution's.  This convention supports
       multiple products in a distribution and is consistent with the
       standard.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the
              distribution.  Providing a distribution tag is optional.  The
              swbis implementation will use this as the [single] path name
              prefix if there is no distribution.control_directory attribute.
              A distribution tag attribute and swpackage's response to it is
              an implementation extension.  The leading package path can also
              be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.


       <b>control_directory</b>

              <i>control</i><b>_</b><i>directory</i>, in a distribution object, is the constant
              leading package path.  Providing this attribute is optional.  A
              distribution control_directory attribute and swpackage's
              response to it is an implementation extension.  The leading
              package path can also be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.
              This attribute will be generated by swpackage if not set in a
              PSF.


   <b>o Bundle Attributes</b>
       A <b>bundle</b> defines a collection of products whether or not the
       distribution has all the products present.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the bundle.
              This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
              component in the installed software catalog.  If it is not
              present the product tag is used.


   <b>o Product Attributes</b>
       A <b>product</b> defines the software product.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the product.
              This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
              component in the installed software catalog.  It is required.
              The swbis implementation uses it in a way that is analogous to
              the RPMTAG_NAME attribute, namely as the public recognizable
              name of the package.


       <b>control_directory</b>

              Is the directory name in the distribution under which the
              product contents are located.  This value has no affect on the
              installed software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then
              the <i>tag</i> is used.


       <b>revision</b>

              Is the product revision.  It should not contain a &quot;RELEASE&quot;
              attribute part or other version suffix modifiers.  This value is
              used by the swbis implementation as a path name component in the
              installed software catalog.  It is required by swinstall.


       <b>vendor_tag</b>

              This is a short identifying name of the distributor that
              supplied the product and may associate (refer to) a <b>vendor</b>
              object from the INDEX file that has a matching tag attribute.
              This attribute is optional.  This attribute value should strive
              to be unique among all distributors. The swbis implementation
              modifies the intended usage slightly as a string that strives to
              be globally unique for a given product.<b>tag</b> and product.<b>revision</b>.
              In this capacity it serves to distinguish products with the same
              revision and tag from the same or different distributor.  It
              most closely maps to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or &quot;debian_revision&quot;
              attributes.  It is one of the version distinguishing attributes
              of a product specified by the standard.  It is transfered into
              the installed_software catalog (not as a path name component) by
              swinstall.  If this attribute exists there should also be a
              <b>vendor</b> object in the PSF in the distribution object that has
              this tag.  This attribute is assigned the value of
              RPMTAG_RELEASE by swpackage when translating an RPM.


       <b>architecture</b>

              This string is one of the version attributes.  It is used to
              disambiguate products that have the same <b>tag</b>, <b>revision</b> and
              <b>vendor_tag</b>.  It is not used for determining a products
              compatibility with a host.  The form is implementation defined.
              swbis uses the output of GNU <b>config.guess</b> as the value of this
              string.  A wildcard pattern should not be used.  The canonical
              swbis architecture string can be listed with <b>swlist</b>. For example

              swlist -a architecture @ localhost

               Here are some example outputs from real systems.

                  System      `uname -srm`              architecture
              Red Hat 8.0:  Linux 2.4.18 i686        i686-pc-linux-gnu

       <b>os_name os_release os_version machine_type</b>

              These attributes are used to determine compatibility with a
              host.  They correspond to the <b>uname</b> attributes defined by
              POSIX.1.  If an value is nil or non-existent it is assumed to
              match the host.  All attributes must match for there to be
              compatibility.  Distributors may wish to make these values a
              shell pattern in their PSF's so to match the intended collection
              of hosts.  swbis uses <b>fnmatch</b> (with FLAGS=0) to determine a
              match.


   <b>o Fileset Attributes</b>
       A <b>fileset</b> defines the fileset.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the fileset.  It
              is required although selection of filesets is  not yet supported
              therefore the end user will have little to do with the fileset
              tag.

       <b>control_directory</b>

              Is the directory name in the product under which the fileset
              contents are located.  This value has no affect on the installed
              software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then the <i>tag</i> is
              used.

   <b>o Example Source Package PSF</b>
       This PSF packages every file is current directory. It uses nil control
       directories so the package structure does not change relative to a
       vanilla tarball.

   <b>o Example Runtime (Binary) Package PSF</b>
       This is a sample PSF for a runtime package.  It implies multiple
       products (e.g. sub-packages) using the bundle.contents attribute.
       Since the bundle and product tags exist in a un-regulated namespace and
       are seen by end users they should be carefully chosen.   Note that the
       bundle and product have the same tag which may force downstream users
       to disambiguate using software selection syntax such as fooit,bv=* or
       fooit,pv=* .

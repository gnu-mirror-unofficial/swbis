       <b>swpackage -s- @-</b>  # Absolutely explicit, same as above

       <b>swpackage @/dev/null</b>   # Useful for debugging

</pre><h3><a name="DESCRIPTION"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>swpackage</b> reads a Product Specification File (PSF) and writes a
       distribution to the specified target.  If no options are given a PSF is
       read on stdin and a distribution is written to the default target
       either a directory, device, or standard output.  To specify standard
       output use a dash '-' as the target.  This implementation only supports
       writing to stdout.
</pre><h3><a name="OPTIONS"><b>OPTIONS</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>software_selections</b>
              Refer to the software objects (products, filesets) on which to
              be operated. (Not yet implemented)

       <b>targets</b>
              Refers to the software_collection where the software selections
              are to be applied.  To specify standard output use a  dash '-',
              this overrides media_type setting to 'serial'.  Target may be a
              file system directory, or device file or '-' Currently this
              implementation only supports a serial archive written to stdout.

       <b>-f FILE</b>
              Reads software_selections from FILE. (Not implemented).

       <b>-p</b>
              Preview the package.  Perform all the packaging operations
              except writing the target.  In verbose level 1, nothing is
              written.  Higher verbose levels write information on stdout.
              Error and warning messages are written to stderr for verbose
              levels 1 and higher.


       <b>-s PSF</b>
              Specify the PSF file, &quot;-&quot; is standard input.

       <b>-x option=value</b>
              Specify the extended option overriding the defaults file value.

       <b>-X FILE</b>
              Specify the extended options filename, FILE,  overriding the
              default filenames.  This option may be given more then once. If
              the resulting specified value is an empty string then reading of
              any options file is disabled.

       <b>-v</b>
              (Implementation extension.) Given one time it is identical to -x
              verbose=2.  This option can be given multiple times with
              increasing effect.
                   level 0: silent on stdout and stderr (not implemented).
                   level 1: fatal and warning messages.
              -v   level 2: level 1 plus file list and trailer message.
              -vv  level 3: level 2 verbose tar-like listing.
              -vvv level 4: level 3 extra verbose tar listing.

       <b>-b BYTES</b>
              Set blocksize to BYTES number of bytes (octets).  The default is
              10240.  (implementation extension)

       <b>--version, -V</b>
              Show version. (Implementation extension)

       <b>--help</b>
              Show help (Implementation extension)

       <b>-W option[,option,...]</b>
              Specify the implementation extension option.
              Syntax: -W option[=option_argument[,option...]
              Options may be separated by a comma.  The implementation
              extension options may also be given individually using the
              '--long-option[=option_arg]' syntax.

       <b>-W cksum</b>
              Compute POSIX cksum of the individual files.

       <b>-W file-digests -W digests</b>
              Compute md5 digests of the individual files.  (-W digests is
              deprecated, use -W file-digests).

       <b>-W files</b>
              Store the distribution file list in .../dfiles/files.

       <b>-W dir=NAME</b>
              Use NAME as the path name prefix of a distribution and also as
              the value of the distribution.control_directory and
              distribution.tag attribute (if not set).  May be set to an empty
              string to eliminate stray leading &quot;./&quot;.

       <b>-W sign</b>
              Compute the md5sum, sha1sum and adjunct_md5sum digests and sign
              the package.

       <b>-W dummy-sign</b>
              Same as -W sign except use a dummy signature.  The signer
              program is not run and no password is required.

       <b>-W signer-pgm=SIGNER</b>
              Recognized SIGNERs are GPG, PGP2.6, and PGP5.  swverify only
              supports GPG, however, other types can be verified manually
              using the options of swverify and command line utilities.

       <b>-W archive-digests</b>
              Compute the md5sum, sha1sum and adjunct_md5sum digests.  See
              <a href=sw_5.html>sw(5)</a> for info on the digest and signed data input files.  The
              sha1sum and md5sum attributes have identical input streams.

       <b>-W no-sha1</b>
              Do not compute the sha1 digest even if directed to by other
              options.  (Deprecated: There is limited reason to use this
              option).

       <b>-W signed-file</b>
              Write only the signed data to the specified target but do not
              sign.  (Deprecated: There is limited reason to use this option).

       <b>-W gpg-name=NAME</b>
              Use NAME as the user ID to sign.  NAME becomes the option arg of
              the gpg --local-user option.

              encrypt with NAME's public key using file system gpg utility


       <b>-W source=FILE</b>
              Use serial archive located at FILE as the source instead of the
              file system.  The files referred by the PSF are taken from the
              serial archive and not the file system.

       <b>-W numeric-owner</b>
              Same as GNU tar option.  Emitted archive has only uid and gids.

       <b>-W absolute-names</b>
              Same as GNU tar option.  Leading slash '/' are always stripped
              unless this option is given.

       <b>-W format=FORMAT</b>
              FORMAT is one of:

               ustar   is the POSIX.1 tar format capable of storing
                       pathnames up to 255 characters in length.
                       Identical to GNU tar 1.15.1 --format=ustar
                       This is the default format but may be changed by
                       the options files.
               ustar0  is a different POSIX.1 tar personality.
                       Identical to GNU tar 1.13.25 --posix -b1 for 99 char pathnames
                       Has different rendering of device numbers for non-device files,
                       but otherwise identical to 'ustar'
               gnu     Identical to GNU tar version 1.15.1 --format=gnu
               oldgnu  Identical to GNU tar version 1.13 and later with
                           block size set to 1. i.e. with option -b1.
                       Also identical to GNU tar 1.15.1 --format=oldgnu
               gnutar  same as oldgnu, oldgnu preferred.

               crc     cpio format (magic 070702).
               bsdpax3 Identical to pax v3.0, ustar format with option -b 512.


       <b>-W create-time=TIME</b>
              Applies to catalog files and the create_time attribute.  TIME is
              the seconds since the Unix Epoch.  You must use this option to
              make the catalog directory identical in subsequent (back-to-
              back) invocations.

       <b>-W list-psf</b>
              Write the PSF to stdout after having processed the extended
              definitions.

       <b>-W to-swbis</b>
              Read a package on standard input and write a POSIX package on
              standard output.  Requires the .../libexec/swbis/lxpsf program.
              Supported formats are any supported format of lxpsf.  Identical

              Read the passphrase on file descriptor N.

       <b>-W passfile=FILE</b>
              Read the passphrase from FILE in the file system.  Setting FILE
              to /dev/tty resets (i.e unsets) all passphrase directives, thus
              establishing the default action, reading from the terminal.

       <b>-W dir-owner=OWNER</b>
              Set the owner of the leading directory archive member to OWNER.
              If the option arg is &quot;&quot;, then the owner is the owner of the
              current directory.

       <b>-W dir-group=OWNER</b>
              Set the group of the leading directory archive member to OWNER.
              If the option arg is &quot;&quot;, then the owner is the owner of the

       <b>-W dir-modep=MODE</b>
              Set the file permissions mode of the leading directory archive
              member to MODE.

       <b>-W catalog-owner=OWNER</b>
              Set the owner of the catalog section to OWNER.

       <b>-W catalog-group=GROUP</b>
              Set the group of the catalog section to GROUP.

       <b>-W files-from=NAME</b>
              Read a list of files from file NAME.  Directories are not
              descended recursively.

       <b>-W show-options-files</b>
              Show the complete list of options files and if they are found.

       <b>-W show-options</b>
              Show the options after reading the files and parsing the command
              line options.

       <b>-W no-catalog</b>
              Do not write the catalog section.

       <b>-W no-front-dir</b>
              Do not write the directory archive members that preceed the

</pre><h3><a name="PACKAGE SIGNING"><b>PACKAGE SIGNING</b></a></h3><pre>       Support for embedded cryptographic signature.

   <a name="Description"><b>Description</b></a>
       Package signing is accomplished by including, as a package attribute, a
       detached signature in the package metadata (the catalog section of the
       package).  The signed data is the catalog section of the package (see
       <a href=sw_5.html>sw(5)</a> for a description) excluding the signature files archive header
       and data.  The package leading directory that does not contain the
       /catalog/ directory in its name is not included in the signed stream.
       The signed stream is terminated by <a href=two _2.html>two (2)</a> null tar blocks (which are
       not in the actual package file).  The storage section (or payload) of
       the package is included in the signed data by computing its md5 and
       sha1 message digests and storing these as attributes in the catalog
       section.

   <a name="Signature Generation"><b>Signature Generation</b></a>
       The signature is generated by the file system signing utility.
       Currently, swpackage supports GPG PGP-2.6 and PGP-5.  The default is
       GPG but can be selected using the <b>-Wsigner-pgm</b> command line option and
       the <b>swpackage.swbis_signer_pgm</b> defaults file option.  The options and
       program can the displayed with the <b>-Wshow-signer-pgm</b> option.  The
       options in each case produce a detached ascii-armored signature.  The
       maximum length for the ascii armored file is 1023 bytes.

   <a name="Passphrase Handling"><b>Passphrase Handling</b></a>
       The passphrase can be read from the tty, a file descriptor, and
       environment variable or the GNUpg passphrase agent.  These are
       controlled by the options or the environment variables SWPACKAGEPASSFD
       and SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE.  Placing your passphrase in an environment
       variable is insecure but may be usefull to sign packages with a test
       key and later replace it [when on a different host for example].
</pre><h3><a name="SIGNATURE VERIFICATION"><b>SIGNATURE VERIFICATION</b></a></h3><pre>       swpackage does not perform verification of the embedded cryptographic
       signature, although, a description is included here for completness.

   <a name="Overview"><b>Overview</b></a>
       Verification requires verifying the payload section md5 and sha1
       message digests and then verifying the signature.  Naturally, it is
       required that the signed data include the payload messages digests.
       See swverify.

   <a name="Manual Verification"><b>Manual Verification</b></a>
       Verification requires re-creating the signed and digested byte streams
       from the archive file.  This is not possible using any known extant tar
       reading utility because of a lack of ability to write selected archive
       members to stdout instead of installing in the file system; however,
       the swverify utility can be used to write these bytes streams to stdout
       allowing manual inspection and verification.  See swverify.

   <a name="Manual Verification Using Standard Tools"><b>Manual Verification Using Standard Tools</b></a>
       Verification using standard GNU/Linux tools is possible if the archive
       is installed in the file system.  Success depends on the following
       factors:

       1) The tar utility preserves modification times
          (e.g. not GNU tar 1.3.19).
       2) The archive does not contain Symbolic Links
          (see <a href=sw_5.html>sw(5)</a> for explanation).
       3) The file system is a Unix file system (e.g. ext2).
       4) The package was created using -Wformat=gnutar or, -Wformat=ustar
          with no file name longer than 99 octets.

        Recreating the signed and digested byte streams is then accomplished
       using GNU tar and the file list stored in the
       &lt;<i>path</i>&gt;/catalog/dfiles/files attribute file as follows:

       In this example, the package has a single path name prefix called,
       <b>namedir</b> and the file owner/group are root.  These restrictions are
       suited to source packages.
       Verify the signature:

         #!/bin/sh
         tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
         --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \
         namedir/catalog | gpg --verify namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature -

        If this fails try using GNU tar option --posix.  If this fails then
       you are out of luck as nothing in the catalog section can be trusted.

       Verify the payload digests:

         #!/bin/sh
         grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
         tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
         --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum
         cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/md5sum

        Likewise for the sha1 digest.

       If the package has symbolic links, Verify the adjunct_md5sum:

         #!/bin/sh
         grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \
         ( while read file; do if [ ! -h $file ]; then echo $file; fi done; )|\
         tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \
         --files-from=- --no-recursion | md5sum
         cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/adjunct_md5sum

        The symbolic link files must be verified manually by comparing to the
       INFO file information.
</pre><h3><a name="SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT"><b>SWPACKAGE OUTPUT FORMAT</b></a></h3><pre>       The output format is either one of two formats specified in POSIX.1
       (ISO/IEC 9945-1) which are tar (header magic=ustar) or cpio (header
       magic=070707).  The default format of the swbis implementation is
       &quot;ustar&quot;.  The POSIX spec under specifies definitions for some of the
       ustar header fields.  The personality of the default swbis ustar format
       mimics GNU tar 1.15.1 and is designed to be compliant to POSIX.1.  The
       personality of the &quot;ustar0&quot; format mimics, for pathnames less than 99
       octets,  GNU tar 1.13.25 using the &quot;-b1 --posix&quot; options.  This bit-
       for-bit sameness does not exist for pathnames greater than 99 chars as
       swbis follows the POSIX spec and GNU tar 1.13.25 does not.  The
       &quot;ustar0&quot; ustar personality is deprecated.  It is only slightly
       different from 'ustar' in how device number fields are filled (with
       spaces, zeros or NULs) for non-device files.

       In addition the swbis implementation supports several other tar
       variants including bit-for-bit mimicry of GNU tar (1.13.25) default
       format which uses a non-standard name split and file type (type 'L').
       This format is known as '--format=oldgnu'.  Also supported is the gnu
       format of GNU tar 1.15.1 specified by '--format=gnu'

       The defacto cpio formats are also supported.  &quot;new ASCII&quot; (sometimes
       called SVR4 cpio) and &quot;crc&quot; cpio formats with header magic &quot;070701&quot; and
       &quot;070702&quot; respectively.

       Support for &quot;pax Interchange Format&quot; (Extended header tar) described in
       IEEE 1003.1-2001 under the &quot;pax&quot; manual page is planned.

       The entirety of the output byte stream is a single valid file of one
       the formats mentioned above.

       The swbis implementation writes its output to stdout.  The default
       output block size is 10240 bytes.  The last block is not padded and
       therefore the last <a href=write_2.html>write(2)</a> may be a short write.  The selected block
       size does not affect the output file contents.

       The swbis implementation is biased, in terms of capability and default
       settings, to the tar format.  Package signing is only supported in tar
       format.
</pre><h3><a name="SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT"><b>SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT</b></a></h3><pre>       The input file is called a product specification file or PSF.  It
       contains information to direct swpackage and information that is
       package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged into the global
       INDEX file].

       A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs) and
       Extended Definitions (described below).  An object keyword connotes a
       logical object (i.e. software structure) supported by the standard.  An
       object keyword does not have a value field after it, as it contains
       Attributes and Extended Definitions.  An attribute keyword conotes an
       attribute which is always in the form of a keyword/value pair.

       Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and are
       transferred into the INDEX file.  Object keywords not recognized by the
       standard are not allowed and will generate an error.  Extended
       Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created
       by swpackage).  Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into
       object keywords (objects) and attributes recognized by the standard.

       Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the swbis
       implementation of swpackage.

       The file syntax is the same as a <b>INDEX</b>, or <b>INFO</b> file.  A PSF may
       contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended
       definitions.

       For additional information see
       XDSA C701 <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm">http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c701.htm</a>, or
       sw manual page.

   <a name="EXTENDED DEFINITIONS"><b>EXTENDED DEFINITIONS</b></a>
       A Product Specification File (PSF) can contain Extended Definitions in
       the <b>fileset</b>, <b>product</b> or <b>bundle</b> software definitions.  They would have
       the same level or containment relationship as a <b>file</b> or <b>control_file</b>
       definition in the same contaning object.

       Extended Definitions represent a minimal, expressive form for
       specifying files and file attributes.  Their use in a PSF is optional
       in that an equivalent PSF can be constructed without using them,
       however, their use is encouraged for the sake of brevity and
       orthogonality.

       The swbis implementation requires that no [ordinary] attributes appear
       after Extended Definitions in the containing object, and, requires that
       Extended Definitions appear before logically contained objects.  That
       is, the parser uses the next object keyword to syntacticly and
       logically terminate the current object even if the current object has
       logically contained objects.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Extended Control File Definitions</b>
            checkinstall  <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            preinstall    <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]

            space         <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]
            control_file  <i>source</i>  [<i>path</i>]


       The <i>source</i> attribute defines the location in distributors's development
       system where the swpackage utility will find the script.  The keyword
       is the value of the <i>tag</i> attribute and tells the utilities when to
       execute the script.  The <i>path</i> attribute is optional and specifies the
       file name in the packages distribution relative to the
       control_directory for software containing the script. If not given the
       <i>tag</i> value is used as the filename.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Directory Mapping</b>
          directory  <i>source</i>  [<i>destination</i>]


       Applies the <i>source</i> attribute as the directory under which the
       subsequently listed files are located.  If <i>destination</i> is defined it
       will be used as a prefix to the <i>path</i> (implied) file definition.  <i>source</i>
       is typically a temporary or build location and <i>dest</i> is its unrealized
       absolute pathname destination.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Recursive File Definition</b>
         file *


       Specifies every file in current source directory.  The <i>directory</i>
       extended definition must be used before the recursive specification.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Explicit File Definition</b>
         file [-t <i>type</i>] [-m <i>mode</i>] [-o <i>owner</i>[,<i>uid</i>]] [-g <i>group</i>[,<i>gid</i>]] [-n] [-v] source [<i>path</i>]


       <b>source</b>


              <i>source</i> defines the pathname of the file to be used as the source
              of file data and/or attributes.  If it is a relative path, then
              swpackage searches for this file relative to the the source
              argument of the <b>directory</b> keyword, if set.  If <b>directory</b> keyword
              is not set then the search is relative to the current working
              directory of the swpackage utility's invocation.

              All attributes for the destination file are taken from the
              source file, unless a <b>file_permissions</b> keyword is active, or the
              -m, -o, or -g options are also included in the file
              specification.

       <b>path</b>

              <i>path</i> defines the destination path where the file will be created
              or installed.  If it is a relative path, then the destination
              path of the of the <b>directory</b> keyword must be active and will be
              used as the path prefix.  If path is not specified then <i>source</i>
              is used as the value of path and directory mapping applied (if
              active).

       <b>-t type</b>

              <i>type</i> may one of 'd' (directory), or  'h' (hard link), or 's'
              (symbolic link).

              -t d  Create a directory.
              If <i>path</i> is not specified <i>source</i> is used as the path attribute.

              -t h  Create a hard link.
              <i>path</i> and <i>source</i> are specified.  <i>source</i> is used as the value of
              the <i>link</i><b>_</b><i>source</i> attribute, and <i>path</i> is the value of the path
              attribute.

              -t s  Create a symbolic link.
              <i>path</i> and <i>source</i> are specified.  <i>source</i> is used as the value of
              the <i>link</i><b>_</b><i>source</i> attribute, and <i>path</i> is the value of the path
              attribute.

       <b>-m mode</b>

              <i>mode</i> defines the octal mode for the file.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Default Permission Definition</b>
         file_permissions [-m <i>mode</i>] [-u <i>umask</i>] [-o [<i>owner</i>[,]][<i>uid</i>]] [-g [<i>group</i>[,]][<i>gid</i>]]


       Applies to subsequently listed file definitions in a fileset.  These
       attributes will apply where the file attributes were not specified
       explicitly in a file definition.  Subsequent <b>file_permissions</b>
       definitions simply replace previous definitions (resetting all the
       options).

       To reset the file_permission state (i.e. turn it off) use one of the
       following:
           file_permissions &quot;&quot;
            or the preferred way is
           file_permissions -u 000

   <b>o</b>  <b>Excluding Files</b>
          exclude source


       Excludes a previously included file or an entire directory.

   <b>o</b>  <b>Including Files</b>
          include &lt;<i>filename</i>


       The contents of <i>filename</i> may be more definitions for files.  The syntax
       of the included file is PSF syntax.


   <a name="SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS"><b>SWBIS PSF CONVENTIONS</b></a>
       This section describes attribute usage and conventions imposed by the
       swbis implementation.  Not all attributes are listed here.  Those that
       are have important effects or particular interest.

   <b>o Distribution Attributes</b>
       The standard defines a limited set of attributes for the distribution
       object.  An expanded set is suggested by the informative annex however
       a conforming implementation is not required act on them.  The reason
       for this is a distribution may be acted upon by a conforming utility in
       such a way that attributes of the <b>distribution</b> become invalid.  For
       this reason, some attributes that refer to an entire &quot;package&quot; [in
       other package managers] are referred from the product object and attain
       their broadened scope by the distributor's convention that their
       distribution contains just one <b>product</b>.

       For example, the package NAME and VERSION are referred from the product
       tag and revision, not the distribution's.  This convention supports
       multiple products in a distribution and is consistent with the
       standard.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the
              distribution.  Providing a distribution tag is optional.  The
              swbis implementation will use this as the [single] path name
              prefix if there is no distribution.control_directory attribute.
              A distribution tag attribute and swpackage's response to it is
              an implementation extension.  The leading package path can also
              be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.


       <b>control_directory</b>

              <i>control</i><b>_</b><i>directory</i>, in a distribution object, is the constant
              leading package path.  Providing this attribute is optional.  A
              distribution control_directory attribute and swpackage's
              response to it is an implementation extension.  The leading
              package path can also be controlled with the ''-W dir'' option.
              This attribute will be generated by swpackage if not set in a
              PSF.


   <b>o Bundle Attributes</b>
       A <b>bundle</b> defines a collection of products whether or not the
       distribution has all the products present.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the bundle.
              This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
              component in the installed software catalog.  If it is not
              present the product tag is used.


   <b>o Product Attributes</b>
       A <b>product</b> defines the software product.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the product.
              This value is used by the swbis implementation as a path name
              component in the installed software catalog.  It is required.
              The swbis implementation uses it in a way that is analogous to
              the RPMTAG_NAME attribute, namely as the public recognizable
              name of the package.


       <b>control_directory</b>

              Is the directory name in the distribution under which the
              product contents are located.  This value has no affect on the
              installed software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then
              the <i>tag</i> is used.


       <b>revision</b>

              Is the product revision.  It should not contain a &quot;RELEASE&quot;
              attribute part or other version suffix modifiers.  This value is
              used by the swbis implementation as a path name component in the
              installed software catalog.  It is required by swinstall.


       <b>vendor_tag</b>

              This is a short identifying name of the distributor that
              supplied the product and may associate (refer to) a <b>vendor</b>
              object from the INDEX file that has a matching tag attribute.
              This attribute is optional.  This attribute value should strive
              to be unique among all distributors. The swbis implementation
              modifies the intended usage slightly as a string that strives to
              be globally unique for a given product.<b>tag</b> and product.<b>revision</b>.
              In this capacity it serves to distinguish products with the same
              revision and tag from the same or different distributor.  It
              most closely maps to the RPMTAG_RELEASE or &quot;debian_revision&quot;
              attributes.  It is one of the version distinguishing attributes
              of a product specified by the standard.  It is transfered into
              the installed_software catalog (not as a path name component) by
              swinstall.  If this attribute exists there should also be a
              <b>vendor</b> object in the PSF in the distribution object that has
              this tag.  This attribute is assigned the value of
              RPMTAG_RELEASE by swpackage when translating an RPM.


       <b>architecture</b>

              This string is one of the version attributes.  It is used to
              disambiguate products that have the same <b>tag</b>, <b>revision</b> and
              <b>vendor_tag</b>.  It is not used for determining a products
              compatibility with a host.  The form is implementation defined.
              swbis uses the output of GNU <b>config.guess</b> as the value of this
              string.  A wildcard pattern should not be used.  The canonical
              swbis architecture string can be listed with <b>swlist</b>. For example

              swlist -a architecture @ localhost

               Here are some example outputs from real systems.

                  System      `uname -srm`              architecture
              Red Hat 8.0:  Linux 2.4.18 i686        i686-pc-linux-gnu

       <b>os_name os_release os_version machine_type</b>

              These attributes are used to determine compatibility with a
              host.  They correspond to the <b>uname</b> attributes defined by
              POSIX.1.  If an value is nil or non-existent it is assumed to
              match the host.  All attributes must match for there to be
              compatibility.  Distributors may wish to make these values a
              shell pattern in their PSF's so to match the intended collection
              of hosts.  swbis uses <b>fnmatch</b> (with FLAGS=0) to determine a
              match.


   <b>o Fileset Attributes</b>
       A <b>fileset</b> defines the fileset.

       <b>tag</b>

              <i>tag</i> is the short, file system friendly, name of the fileset.  It
              is required although selection of filesets is  not yet supported
              therefore the end user will have little to do with the fileset
              tag.

       <b>control_directory</b>

              Is the directory name in the product under which the fileset
              contents are located.  This value has no affect on the installed
              software catalog.  If it is not given in a PSF then the <i>tag</i> is
              used.

   <b>o Example Source Package PSF</b>
       This PSF packages every file is current directory. It uses nil control
       directories so the package structure does not change relative to a
       vanilla tarball.

   <b>o Example Runtime (Binary) Package PSF</b>
       This is a sample PSF for a runtime package.  It implies multiple
       products (e.g. sub-packages) using the bundle.contents attribute.
       Since the bundle and product tags exist in a un-regulated namespace and
       are seen by end users they should be carefully chosen.   Note that the
       bundle and product have the same tag which may force downstream users
       to disambiguate using software selection syntax such as fooit,bv=* or
       fooit,pv=* .

   <b>o</b>   <b>A PSF that uses directory mapping.</b>
       This PSF creates a package with live system paths from source that is
       installed in non-live temporary locations. It is modeled on the swbis
       source package.

        distribution
        product
          tag somepackage  # this is the package name
          control_directory &quot;&quot;
          revision 1.0  # this is the package revision
        fileset
           tag files
           control_directory &quot;&quot;

           file_permissions -o root -g root
           directory swprogs /usr/bin
           file swpackage
           file swinstall

           file -m 755 -o root -g root / /usr/libexec/swbis

           directory swprogs /usr/libexec/swbis
           file swbisparse

           directory swsupplib/progs /usr/libexec/swbis
           file swbistar

           file -m 755 -o root -g root / /usr/share/doc/swbis
           directory . /usr/share/doc/swbis
           file -m 444 ./README
           file -m 444 CHANGES

       When this PSF is processed by the command:

                   swpackage -Wsign -s - @- | tar tvf -

       It produces the following:

</pre><h3><a name="RETURN VALUE"><b>RETURN VALUE</b></a></h3><pre>       0 on success, 1 on error and target medium not modified, 2 on error if
       target medium modified.
</pre><h3><a name="SIDE EFFECTS"><b>SIDE EFFECTS</b></a></h3><pre>        No temporary files are used in the package generation process.  When
       using the default target of stdout (directed to /dev/null), there are
       no file system side effects from swpackage.  GNU Privacy Guard (gpg)
       may alter its keys when invoked for package signing.
</pre><h3><a name="ENVIRONMENT"><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></a></h3><pre>       <b>SWPACKAGEPASSFD</b>
              Sets the <i>--passphrase-fd</i> option.  Set the option arg to a
              integer value of the file descriptor, or to &quot;env&quot; to read the
              passphrase from the environment variable SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE, or
              to &quot;agent&quot; to cause gpg to use gpg-agent, or to &quot;tty&quot; to restore
              default behavoir to reading passphrase from the terminal.


       <a name="SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE"><b>SWPACKAGEPASSPHRASE</b></a>
              Use the value as the passphrase if <i>--passphrase-fd</i> is set to
              &quot;env&quot;


       <a name="GNUPGHOME"><b>GNUPGHOME</b></a>
              Sets the --gpg-home option.


       <a name="GNUPGNAME"><b>GNUPGNAME</b></a>
              Sets the --gpg-name option, which is turn set the --local-user
              option of gpg.

</pre><h3><a name="REQUISITE UTILITIES"><b>REQUISITE UTILITIES</b></a></h3><pre>       Swpackage does not use any archive writing utilities, it has its own
       code to generate archives.
       Package signing uses one of the following:
        /usr/bin/gpg
        /usr/bin/pgp   (PGP 2.6.x)
        /usr/bin/pgps  (PGP 5)

       Swpackage will use /usr/bin/uuidgen if present to create the uuid.

</pre><h3><a name="BUGS"><b>BUGS</b></a></h3><pre>       A comment after an object keyword is wrongly not allowed by this PSF
       parser.  The --dir=&quot;&quot; does not do what one would expect sometimes.  The
       output stream content is unaffected by the blocksize, that is the last
       write may be short write.  Signing is broken for cpio format archives.
